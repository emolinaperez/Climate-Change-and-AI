However, Yemen recognizes that in order to meet the 2 degree objective all countries will need to undertake mitigation. In view of that, Yemen&rsquo;s approach focuses on avoiding an increase of emissions per capita beyond this level, while pursuing its development goals.</p> <p>In addition, Yemen account for a small share of past global greenhouse gases, it is therefore putting forward actions that align with a low carbon development pathway, which to be fully implemented would require additional international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building. In addition, Yemen&rsquo;s INDC represents its aspiration to increase the resilience to climate change by introducing a comprehensive programme for adaptation action across sectors in support of livelihoods, and economic well-being of the Yemeni people. This represents a high level of fairness and ambition in light of Yemen&rsquo;s national circumstances.""</p>"
