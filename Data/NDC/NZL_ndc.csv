Nonetheless we are taking serious action on each. New Zealand has committed $45 million to the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases out to June 2019 and a further $48.5 million through the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre for research into technology to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Maintaining support for this research will continue to be a priority for us.</p> <p>On transport, in principle New Zealand is well placed to take advantage of its existing baseload of renewable sources of electricity generation (approximately 80 percent in 2014). We have set a target of increasing renewable generation to 90 percent by 2025. This will further support transformation of our transport sector.</p> <p>Transformation of the transport and agriculture sectors will take longer than the 2021-2030 period covered by this INDC. New Zealand's long-term emission pathway anticipates accelerated emission reductions post 2030 once agricultural mitigation technology becomes more widely applied and uptake of low-emission transport technology increases.</p> <p>We recognise tackling atmospheric stocks of carbon dioxide as our most pressing collective problem. The limited domestic abatement potential available to New Zealand requires us to make use of global carbon markets to be able to make a contribution that progresses beyond our current target, as this INDC does.</p> <p>This INDC represents a progression beyond New Zealand&rsquo;s current target, not only in terms of headline number, but also in terms of cost and emissions impact. It also represents a significant reduction from BAU emissions and continuing improvement in the emissions efficiency of the New Zealand economy. The contribution is consistent with the conditional target range pledged by New Zealand at COP 16.</p>"

Each Party must contribute to the extent its circumstances permit. Although New Zealand is responsible for low levels of emissions now&nbsp;and historically (0.15 percent of global emissions in 2012), New Zealand is committed to doing its fair share in working towards a multilateral climate change solution.</p> <p>The likely cost to the New Zealand economy of meeting the 2030 target in terms of GDP is greater than that implied by other Parties&rsquo; tabled targets. This is due to a number of factors, such as already achieving a high level of renewable electricity generation, and almost half of New Zealand&rsquo;s emissions originating from agriculture.""</p>"
