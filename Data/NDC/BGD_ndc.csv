In selecting the actions set out above, Bangladesh has prioritised those which fit with the growth priorities set out in our national development plans. In addition, Bangladesh has captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation, not only by prioritising those adaptation activities with significant mitigation co-benefits, but also by seeking to minimise the carbon footprint of adaptation portfolio as a whole.

Although the following paragraphs mention recent landmark initiatives, achievements and planned actions regarding technology:<br>“Bangladesh Bank established a refinance scheme for supporting environment friendly technology such as solar energy, bio-gas plants, and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP). The initial schemes focused on only 10 products, which has increased to 50 products under 11 categories: renewable energy, energy efficiency, solid waste management, liquid waste management, alternative energy, fire burnt brick, non-fire block brick, recycling and recyclable product, ensuring safety in work environment of factories, etc. Moreover, as of now, 39 banks and 19 financial institutions have signed a participation agreement with Bangladesh Bank to avail finance from this scheme.”<br>”Industries in Bangladesh are massively adopting mitigation through various actions like LEED certification for green buildings, energy efficiency in lighting through introducing CFL/ LED lamps, implementing more energy efficient technology use in fertilizer and cement factories etc.”<br> “Already two city corporations adopted the incineration technology to reduce waste and other two city corporation will also follow them and around 100 municipalities will establish bio-gas plant to reduce emission.
