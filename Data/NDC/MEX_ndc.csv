The National Climate Change Strategy, as it is described in the Law, is the basis of the Mid-Century Strategy that Mexico submitted to the Convention in 2016, which establishes the long-term approach for low emission development.”<br>”Additionally, the NDC identifies actions undertaken by the states to reduce emissions within their jurisdiction and will be registered by the Federal Government, who will supervise and quantify these actions through a monitoring system.” <br>Visit the section on Planning Process in the updated NDC for more information."

The NDC represents the highest level of ambition possible for the country at this time, given its level of development. It is considered to be fair, since Mexico's contribution to global emissions is 1.3% of the global total, with per capita emissions of 3.7 tons, which is below the global average of 5 tons per capita, that is, 4.4 times less than that of our main trading partner, the United States of America with 16.5 tons per capita and half of the world's largest emitter, 7.5 tons per capita.""<br>The reduction of GHG emissions that Mexico proposes to achieve by 2030 in the update of its NDC. It is ambitious since the NDC contains unconditional contributions and additional actions which take into account that Mexico is a developing country. It is appropriate to emphasize that Mexico is currently facing severe difficulties associated with the economic crisis, so endorsing our commitments and providing additional resources to implement new policies is an effort that is being made to allow more countries to join the increase in ambition.""<br>""The NDC is considered ambitious since it incorporates all the recommendations regarding means of updating the NDC and adheres to the methodologies developed by the IPCC, to the effect of the registration of emissions in the INEGy-CEI. Likewise, national funding mechanisms and efforts have been developed in the context of the guidelines and recommendations of the UNFCCC and other relevant international organizations on the subject.""<br>""The increased ambition in the adaptation component aims to be fair with the Mexican population by recognizing the particular vulnerability of certain communities and highlighting the coordinated and common efforts as a nation but differentiated in terms of early attention to the most affected sectors.""<br>""Mexico has incorporated the NDC in its legislation and planning processes, ensuring ways and processes for its implementation. This NDC is a considerable effort undertaken by the country and it demonstrates the highest degree of ambition considering the current possibilities.
