23276237,"Pledges","MNG","Mongolia","Overview","Overview of Commitment",NA,NA,"pledge_content","Pledge content","<p><u>Energy supply: increasing renewable options</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>PV and solar heating</i></p> <p>Mongolia is located in a region with abundant sunshine, and typically receives between 2,250 and 3,300 hours/year. PV systems have been shown to be the less expensive option compared with small gasoline generators. At present, small-scale PV systems (10-1,000 W) are used in remote areas. It has been assessed that PV power systems are competitive with conventional energy sources for small-power applications for nomadic families and communities in Mongolia.</p> <p>The installation of large-scale PV systems in the Gobi region of Mongolia may contribute both to protecting against air pollution and to supporting regional development. It will be necessary to implement pilot research projects in the areas situated along the railway network and to consider PV systems in the Mongolian Gobi desert and steppe areas in the future.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Wind power generators and wind farms</i></p> <p>As in the case of solar energy, there is potential to supply nomadic herders and farmers in rural areas with small, portable wind generation systems. Renewable energy development is included in the Government Action Programme and will serve as the principal way to provide electricity to remote areas and nomadic families. Turbine generators (with a total capacity of 100-150 kW) could be placed in provincial centres in the southern part of Mongolia. The most promising sites should be prioritized according to the technical and economic feasibility of operating wind turbine generators with a total capacity of 100-150 kW in parallel with existing diesel generators.</p> <p>In addition, large-scale wind farm projects could be implemented in Mongolia. The Party already has the experience of establishing a wind farm with a total capacity of 50 MW in Mongolia.</p> <p><i>Hydropower plants</i></p> <p>Hydropower development is one of the best options for electricity supply in remote areas and for consumers with limited demands. A number of promising hydropower sites have been identified in Mongolia. Currently, the Taishir (11 MW) and Durgun (12 MW) hydropower plants are in operation, and more than 20 hydropower sites have been identified, with capacities ranging from 5 MW to 110 MW. The development of these plants is moderately feasible in Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia encourages the use of small- and medium-sized hydroelectric developments. The emissions reduction potential of this option is high, and its local benefits are expected to outweigh the negative impacts.</p> <p>The Taishir and Durgun hydropower plants were registered as CDM projects with CERs of 29,600 and 30,000 t CO2/year, respectively. The 220 MW Egiin gol Hydroelectric Power Generation Project, with potential CERs of 192,500 t/year, is in the project development stage.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving coal quality</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Coal beneficiation</i></p> <p>Mongolia has substantial coal reserves. Coal will continue in the future to be the most economic fuel for power and heat generation in the central energy system and for heat generation in provincial centres. Currently, no provision exists for coal preparation at mining sites and, as a result, there is no quality control in the supply system. Coal quality often does not meet the minimum standard requirements, and in many cases emergency situations at the power stations are caused by the low quality of the coal.</p> <p>Coal washing can be introduced at the biggest coal mines in Mongolia, such as Baganuur, Shivee-Ovoo and Tavantolgoi. This option is technically feasible; there are low institutional barriers. This option is already included in the Mongolian Environmental Action Plan.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Coal briquetting</i></p> <p>Coal is one of the most significant sources of environmental pollution, especially air pollution. Therefore, to introduce the coal briquetting technology may well be an efficient way to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce air pollution. Some studies and investigations on conventional formed coal briquettes have been carried out by several Mongolian organizations. However, the quality of the coal briquettes does not meet the required standards.</p> <p>A feasibility study on the production of conventional coal briquettes carried out by the Mining Institute of Mongolia with the support of the United Nations Development Programme shows that the production cost was estimated at 14,000 togrogs/t (i.e. USD 13.5/t).</p> <p>According to estimates by the Hashimoto Sangyo Company of Japan in Mongolia, the initial capital cost for a small-scale (5,000-6,000 t/year) coal briquetting plant amounts to approximately USD 9.6 million. Compared with other technologies (e.g. liquefaction and gasification) for the production of clean fuel from coal, the coal briquetting technology has several advantages, such as lower investment and lower life cycle costs.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving the efficiency of heating boilers&nbsp;</u><br /> <br /> <i>Improve the efficiency of existing heating boilers and install new, highly energy-efficient ones</i></p> <p>One of the features of the Mongolian climate is the long winter season with extremely cold temperatures, which typically drop to between -30 C and -40 C. Heating is therefore an essential requirement for sustaining life. Typically, small heating boilers in provincial centres use between 800 and 1,200 t of coal/year on average in order to produce 0.8-1.2 MW of power and heating.</p> <p>These boilers provide heating for schools, hospitals, kindergartens and other public institutions with very low efficiency (0.4-0.5 MW) due to outdated equipment. The use of 12 efficient boilers with a capacity of 25 MW would produce a CO2 emissions reduction of 91,000 t/year. The installation of 260 new boilers with a capacity of 1 MW would reduce CO2 emissions by 340,000 t/year.<br /> <br /> <i>Convert hot water boilers into small-capacity thermal power plants</i></p> <p>This option would convert hot water boilers into thermal power plants with a capacity of 5-10 MW. This would provide the heating and power supply for provincial centres and nearby provincial areas. Converting steam boilers into small-capacity thermal power plants (5 - 10 MW) would reduce CO2 emissions by 190,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving household stoves and furnaces</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Change the fuels used for household stoves and furnaces</i></p> <p>Household stoves in cities have poor energy efficiency, pollute the environment and threaten human health due to insufficient fuel burning. One of the potential options to reduce environmental pollution and GHG emissions is to exchange the raw coal used in stoves with LPG and coal briquettes.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Modernize the existing design and implement the new design for household stoves and furnaces</i></p> <p>The modernization of 250,000 household stoves and furnaces would reduce CO2 emissions by 920,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving combined heat and power (CHP) plants</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Improve efficiency and reduce internal use</i></p> <p>At present, six CHP plants are operating in Mongolia with a total installed electrical capacity of 824 MW, a steam production capacity of 7,100 t/h and an annual load factor of 71.4 per cent. The plants' own use for electricity is 22.3 per cent, and for heat production is around 15 per cent. Total CO2 emissions from the CHP sector amounted to 6,372 Gg. Therefore, the CHP plants are one of the main contributors to total national GHG emissions. In particular, energy efficiency improvements, including the reduction of own use, should be seriously considered for GHG mitigation.</p> <p>The implementation of these actions would produce CO2 reductions of 185,000 t/year.<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: increasing the use of electricity for local heating in cities</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Use of electricity from the grid for individual households in cities</i></p> <p>The main purpose of this option is to reduce air pollution and GHG emissions in Ulaanbaatar city. The Government of Mongolia is aware of the need to reduce air pollution in Ulaanbaatar and is investigating many alternative options, including the use of electricity for heating in ""ger"" (traditional tent houses) districts. However, no detailed research has yet been undertaken and no projects have yet been implemented.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the construction sector: energy efficiency improvements in buildings</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Improve the district heating system in buildings</i></p> <p>Energy loss is high in the heat distribution systems of Mongolia. Urgent actions are required to reduce this loss by minimizing leaks and replacing valves and compensators. In addition, residential consumers need to save energy by regulating room temperature.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Install heat and hot water meters in apartments</i></p> <p>In Mongolia, about 30 per cent of the population lives in apartment complexes which are connected to the central heat supply network. Many apartments do not have heat meters and their heating fee and price is calculated based on a fixed tariff that does not reflect the actual amount of heat used.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Carry out insulation improvements to existing buildings and implement new energy-efficient standards for new buildings</i></p> <p>A national study on heat loss concluded that nearly 40 per cent of the heat supply for houses and buildings is lost. The heat loss occurs through windows, walls and doors. Current standards are lower by two to three times; this shows that most houses have a higher than average rate of heat loss.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Improve the lighting efficiency in buildings</i></p> <p>This demand-side management option concerns the use of energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps to replace inefficient incandescent light bulbs. The lighting demand of households and service sectors accounted for 380 GWh and is expected to increase in the future. Currently, most households and about 30 per cent of service and commercial buildings use incandescent light bulbs, while the rest use compact fluorescent lamps.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the industry sector: energy efficiency improvements in industry&nbsp;</u><br /> <br /> <i>Improve housekeeping practices</i></p> <p>Mongolian industries have great potential to save energy through energy-use management. The energy-saving potential in industries can be divided into ""easy"" savings (no- and low-cost), medium-cost savings and long-term possibilities. The energy-saving potential through ""easy"" savings (good housekeeping and energy management) is 15-25 per cent, with a pay-back period of less than one year.</p> <p>The implementation of this option could lead to a CO2 emissions reduction of about 300,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Implement motor efficiency improvements</i></p> <p>Mongolia relies heavily on motor systems to power the operations of the industrial sector. Motor systems consume about 70 per cent of industrial electricity in Mongolia. These motor systems are often less efficient than those in industrialized countries. Motor efficiency improvement technology includes: energy-efficient motors; variable speed drives; improved operation and maintenance; the correction of previous oversizing; improved mechanical power transmission; and the efficiency of driven equipment. It is estimated that the electricity-saving potential equates to 20 per cent of total electricity consumption by industrial motors.</p> <p>The implementation of this option could lead to a CO2 emissions reduction of about 240,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Introducing dry processing in the cement industry</i></p> <p>Changing the wet processing of cement to dry processing would save a large amount of energy. Feasibility studies show that 25 per cent of all industrial coal is used for cement production. The wet processing of cement requires 1,500 to 1,700 kcal/kg.cl of heating, whereas dry processing requires between 1,000 and 1,200 kcal/kg.cl. This shows that the energy-saving potential of coal consumption in the cement sector is about 40 per cent. The reduction in CO2 emissions from the implementation of this option would be about 147,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the transport sector</u>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Use of more fuel-efficient vehicles</i></p> <p>A total of 200,288 vehicles were registered in Mongolia in 2007, which represents a significant increase of 1.9 times the number of registered vehicles in 2000. This rapid growth in traffic and in the transport load has intensified the negative impacts on public health and environmental pollution. To promote the import of fuel-efficient vehicles, economic measures, such as the implementation of used vehicle import standards and a vehicle registration tax, could be implemented in order to improve the overall fuel efficiency of vehicles.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>In the agriculture sector</i></p> <p>Limit the increase in the total number of livestock by increasing the productivity of each type of animal, especially cattle.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the forestry sector</u><br /> <br /> <i>Improve forest management</i></p> <p>Mongolian forests provide a multitude of services with regard to climate change and other environmental problems, including serving as carbon sinks, sources of renewable energy, watershed protection and soil erosion protection. Many of these services have been lost, or will be lost, due to the extreme pressure exerted on Mongolia's forest resources.</p> <p>The following major mitigation options have been identified for the forestry sector:&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (a) Natural regeneration;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (b) Forestry plantation;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (c) Agroforestry;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (d) Shelter belts;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (e) Bioelectricity.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, improve the sustainable management of forests and enhance forest carbon stocks in the Mongolian forestry sector</i></p> <p>There is some potential for GHG emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation in Mongolia. It would therefore be possible to initiate and implement a REDD project in Mongolia through reforestation activities by implementing community-based forest management improvements and the sustainable use of forest resources.</p>"
