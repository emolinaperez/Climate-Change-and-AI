Despite its negligible responsibility for global warming and its LDC status, Benin has adopted a climate change management program that includes actions for all fields of climate change management. Through the implementation of its contribution, Benin will strengthen its carbon sequestration potential by its national forest cover, while its cumulative emissions from now till 2030 will decline compared to the reference year. An effort is underway to fight against air pollution by improving traffic flow (construction of specific structures for major intersections, bicycle lanes and pedestrian paths development) especially in the city of Cotonou, the tax and customs exemption on 4T motorcycles and motorcycle parts to the detriment of 2T motorcycles, the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing rail network for public transport development, despite the pressure exerted by these measures on its budget. In the energy sector, biomass energy (firewood, charcoal) is the most consumed form of energy in Benin. The country is dependent on outside supplies for commercial energy (petroleum products and electricity). The measures envisaged in the INDC they seek the welfare of the people, while they are also oriented towards cleaner energy and energy conservation, including energy efficiency and power generation from renewable energy source despite the additional costs they generate.</p>"
