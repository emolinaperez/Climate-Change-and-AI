It is a significant increase from the UK’s previous contribution to the EU’s Intended NDC of 40% by 2030, which was estimated to be a 53% UK reduction on reference levels.<br>""The level of the NDC is consistent with advice from the CCC. The CCC stated that an NDC of at least 68% ‘would constitute a decisive commitment to a net zero emissions trajectory, consistent with the Paris Agreement’ and ‘would place the UK among the leading countries in climate ambition.’<br>""BEIS led work across UK Government departments to identify the UK’s highest possible ambition, taking account of robust analysis of domestic decarbonisation potential, guidance from the CCC, the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the equity principles identified in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report."""
