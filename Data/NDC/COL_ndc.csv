These are actions that Colombia commits to undertake using its own resources, both private and public; the Party would not require any international or market-based funding;<br /> <br /> (b) Actions with financial support:<br /> <br /> (i) Colombia will reduce deforestation in the Colombian Amazon rainforest to zero by 2020;<br /> <br /> (ii) Colombia will stimulate the growth of biofuel production, such as ethanol and biodiesel, without endangering the natural forests or the food security of the Colombian people, and by promoting the use of these fuels in the national market with the aim of achieving a 20 per cent share of total national fuel consumption by 2020. These are actions that Colombia is interested in undertaking and willing to do, but it lacks the necessary resources or capacity, and will therefore require financial support for their implementation; <br /> <br /> (c) Actions related to carbon markets:<br /> <br /> (i) Colombia supports the use of market-based mechanisms in order to contribute to GHG mitigation actions in developing countries. Colombia has made use of the existing flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, especially the CDM, for which Colombia has a project portfolio with an estimated annual emissions reduction potential of 17.4 Mt CO2;<br /> <br /> (ii) Colombia has great potential to reduce emissions from deforestation (REDD) through the protection of endangered forests and the inclusion of new protected areas in the national parks programme;<br /> <br /> (iii) Colombia has estimated a total emissions reduction of up to 54.8 Mt CO2 by 2020 through the implementation of the CDM in the energy, forest, industrial, transport and waste management sectors. Up to now, eight projects in Colombia have been accredited with 763,371 certified emission reduction (CER) units from activities related to wind power generation, mass transport systems and hydroelectric power generation;<br /> <br /> (iv) Colombia will encourage commercial reforestation through the use of Forest Incentive Certificates;<br /> <br /> (v) Colombia has great mitigation potential that could be realized through the implementation of the existing flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the future mechanisms that may arise from negotiations, which would help the Party to achieve greater emission reductions by deviating from the 'business as usual' scenario.<br /> The implementation of these mitigation actions could be supported by carbon market-based mechanisms. These actions include: (a) the capacity to measure, report and verify emission reductions for their subsequent sale; (b) the availability of measuring and monitoring tools (similar to CDM mechanisms); (c) the possibility of achieving the financial closure of the projects or activity programmes with the incentive of selling the emission reductions."
