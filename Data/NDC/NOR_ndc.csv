Norway estimated that the contribution of LULUCF to its target is of the order of 6 per cent of 1990 emissions based on the current LULUCF accounting rules under the Kyoto Protocol, which is equivalent to 3 Mt CO2 eq. In the event that the LULUCF rules change, Norway would modify its target for 2020 with a view to maintaining the overall high ambition of this target."
23275095,"Pledges","NOR","Norway","Mitigation","Overall Assumptions and Methodologies",NA,NA,"pledge_imm","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","On the use of market-based mechanisms, Norway estimates that about two thirds of emission reductions in 2020 would be achieved through domestic emission reduction efforts, which is equivalent to 15-17 Mt CO2 eq, with the remaining part coming from CDM, JI, international emissions trading and any other market-based mechanisms that may be established under the Convention. If Norway should move to its higher target of 40 per cent reduction, this would entail considerable use of carbon credits. <br /> An important feature of Norwegian climate change policy is the flexible and cost-effective Kyoto Protocol based approach. Norway underlined the importance of pursuing various approaches, including opportunities to use markets post-2012. <br /> Availability of flexible mechanisms is an underlying premise for Norway's emission targets.
