In spite of these challenges, Brazil's current actions in the global effort against climate change represent one of the largest undertakings by any single country to date, having reduced its emissions by 41% (GWP-100; IPCC SAR)in 2012 in relation to 2005 levels.</p> <p>Brazil is nevertheless willing to further enhance its contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention, in the context of sustainable development. Brazil's iNDC represents a progression in relation to its current undertakings, in both the type and levels of ambition, while recognizing that emissions will grow to meet social and development needs.</p> <p>By adopting an economy-wide, absolute mitigation target, Brazil will follow a more stringent modality of contribution, compared to its voluntary actions pre-2020. This contribution is consistent with emission levels of 1.3 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5)in 2025 and 1.2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5)in 2030, corresponding, respectively, to a&nbsp;reduction of 37% and 43%, based on estimated emission levels of 2.1 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP- 100; IPCC AR5) in 2005.</p> <p>In relation to Brazil's existing national voluntary commitment, which aims to achieve gross emissions of approximately 2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020, this iNDC represents an additional gross reduction of approximately 19% in 2025. Furthermore, this contribution is consistent with reductions of 6% in 2025 and 16% in 2030 below 1990 levels (1.4 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e GWP-100; IPCC AR5).</p> <p>Brazil's iNDC corresponds to an estimated reduction of 66% in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP (emissions intensity) in 2025 and of 75% in terms of emissions intensity in 2030, both in relation to 2005.</p> <p>In the period 2004-2012, Brazil's GDP increased by 32%, while emissions dropped 52% (GWP-100; IPCC AR5), delinking economic growth from emission increase over the period, while at the same time Brazil lifted more than 23 million people out of poverty.</p> <p>Per capita emissions decreased from 14.4 tCO2e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5) in 2004 to an estimated 6.5 tCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5)in 2012. At this 2012 level, Brazil's per capita emissions are already equivalent to what some developed countries have considered fair and ambitious for their average per capita emissions by 2030. Brazil's per capita emissions will decline further to an estimated 6.2 tCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5) in 2025 and 5.4 tCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5) in 2030 under this contribution.</p> <p>Brazil will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the context of continued population and GDP growth, as well as income per capita increase, making therefore this contribution unequivocally very ambitious.</p> <p>Brazil's mitigation actions to implement this contribution, including its current undertakings, are consistent with the 2&deg;C temperature goal, in light of IPCC scenarios and national circumstances.</p> <p>According to the IPCC, global scenarios consistent with a likely chance to keep temperature change below 2&deg;C relative to pre-industrial levels are characterized, inter alia, by:</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">i) sustainable use of bioenergy;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">ii) large-scale measures relating to land use change and forests;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">iii) tripling to nearly quadrupling the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply globally by the year 2050.</p> <p>In this context, Brazil already has one of the largest and most successful biofuel programs to date, including cogeneration of electricity using biomass. Brazil has achieved the most impressive results of any country in reducing emissions from deforestation, mainly by reducing the deforestation rate in the Brazilian Amazonia by 82% between 2004 and 2014. Brazil's energy mix today consists of 40% of renewables (75% of renewables in its electricity supply), which amounts to three times the world average in renewables, and more than four times the OECD average.
