First time period covers the years 2000-2015.

Second and third time- periods are from 2016 to 2020 and 2021-2030 respectively.</p> <p>3.1. Scenario 1: Economic diversification with a robust contribution from oil and its derivatives export revenues. Export revenues channelled into investments in high valueadded sectors such as financial services, medical services, tourism, education, renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to enhance economic growth. Ambitions outlined in this INDC are set under this scenario.</p> <p>3.2. Scenario 2: Accelerated domestic industrialization based on sustainable utilization of oil and gas. A heavy industrial base built to use domestic oil resources asfeedstock or energy source. Increasing contributions of petrochemical, cement, mining and metal production industries to the national economy. Economic growth will be much slower under this scenario, and will be difficult for the Kingdom to finance its INDC ambitions with domestic resources. In this case, this INDC will be adjusted to account for this scenario.</p> <p>3.3. The main difference between the two baseline scenarios is the allocation of oil produced for either domestic consumption or export. While exported oil will not contribute to the GHG emissions of Saudi Arabia, the domestic consumption will increase its GHG emissions. For the ex-ante estimations, the baseline is determined based on differently weighted combinations of the two scenarios.
