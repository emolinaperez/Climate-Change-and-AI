It has a human development index (HDI) Value of 0.477(compared to the global average of 0.698) and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of only 1,607 (2011 PPP $) (compared to the global average of 12,600 (2011 PPP $)).</li> </ul> <p>In light of these factors, Uganda&rsquo;s contribution is both fair and ambitious. It prioritises specific measures in energy supply, forestry and wetlands to provide both Greenhouse Gas emission reductions as well as development benefits. As of 2011, only 15% of Uganda&rsquo;s population had access to electricity. By committing to increase Uganda&rsquo;s renewable energy generation capacity by 2030 and prioritising the construction of enabling infrastructure for the electricity sector, Uganda is not only reducing its emissions by approximately 3.2 Million tons Carbon dioxide equivalent per year , but also enabling greater access to reliable and sustainable energy for the 85% of Uganda&rsquo;s population that live in rural areas, in turn, improving the livelihoods and health of rural populations.</p> <p>Uganda&rsquo;s greatest mitigation potential is in the land use, land-use change and forestry sectors. Reversing the current deforestation trend (of approximately 14% in 2013) to increase forest cover to 21% in 2030 is highly ambitious considering that 89.5% of the country&rsquo;s energy needs are currently met by charcoal and firewood. This commitment further highlights the holistic nature of Uganda&rsquo;s contribution &ndash; recognising that the development of the electricity sector is key to achieving the reduction in wood and charcoal burning necessary to reduce deforestation.</p> <p>In addition, by focusing on these policies and measures, Uganda will also ensure alignment with its long-term adaptation goals in terms of forest protection, reduction of the energy deficit and resilient energy infrastructure. By structuring its contribution in this way, Uganda is able to contribute to the global efforts to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and contribute to the achievement of the objective of the Convention, while at the same time addressing domestic development needs and priorities.</p> <p>Despite the ambition of Uganda&rsquo;s proposed contribution, additional assistance would enable Uganda to increase its resilience and realise greater Greenhouse Gas emissions reductions. Uganda&rsquo;s contribution therefore includes a range of additional measures in key priority sectors based on the potential to reduce GHG emissions, provide development benefits and adaptation co-benefits. An example of one of these key sectors is agriculture. Approximately 80% of the population is directly reliant on the agricultural sector for their livelihood. It is also one of the most vulnerable to climate impacts, and represents significant additional mitigation potential.</p> <p>Accessing additional support to achieve the measures outlined in this Intended Nationally Determined Contribution would significantly increase the ability of Uganda to achieve more ambitious action in this and other key sectors.""</p>"
