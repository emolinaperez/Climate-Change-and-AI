In order to successfully deliver on the contributions outlined in this INDC a number of steps have already been taken:</p> <p>i. Brunei Darussalam&rsquo;s Initial National Communication and GHG inventory is being drafted. This is the country&rsquo;s first GHG inventory which will give the first accurate estimation of sectoral GHG emissions and will assist with policy development, along with international reporting requirements (e.g. BURs);</p> <p>ii. Brunei Darussalam established the Brunei National Energy Research Institute (BNERI) in 2011 to assist with the formulation of energy policy;</p> <p>iii. Brunei Darussalam&rsquo;s National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) has developed a Strategic National Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction, along with the private sector, non-governmental organisations, local bodies and other national agencies, to ensure a safer and disaster resilient country and community;</p> <p>iv. Sectoral adaption plans currently exist; with further effort these can been developed into a national integrated and coordinated adaptation plan;</p> <p>v. Brunei Darussalam is and will continue to participate in regional networks, such as the ASEAN forum to strengthen regional collaboration efforts, research studies on climate change and its impacts on&nbsp;ASEAN countries&rsquo; biodiversity, and organised future activities on &ldquo;Green themes&rdquo;. This will help the nation to better understand future climate risks and play an active role in co-ordinated regional actions such as the Heart of Borneo Initiative;</p> <p>vi. In terms of flood mitigation, river quality improvement and coastal protection the Government of Brunei Darussalam has outlined an action plan comprised of both structural (physical defences) and non-structural (institutional) measures that are currently being and will be implemented in Brunei Darussalam;</p> <p>vii. The Government of Brunei Darussalam will continue to promote inter-ministerial and interdepartmental co-ordination and collaboration to achieve goals with respect to forestry protection and its associated adaptation benefits. Already for example, revenue generated by the energy sector has financially supported:<br />a. The development of the setup of the project implementation framework of the Heart of Borneo Initiative<br />b. The project &ldquo;Biodiversity Action Plan for Peat Swamp Forest&rdquo;</p> <p>viii. Other areas identified where an integrated approach will be pursued is in the fight against diseases, the incidence of which may be increased due to climate change; and</p> <p>ix. With current limitations on land space for agriculture, the Government of Brunei Darussalam recognises the need to have more efficient agriculture production to meet the increasing demand and to ensure that the crops are resilient to withstand the future impacts of climate change, such as temperature increases and higher risk of flooding.""</p><p>See Brunei's full INDC submission for the energy and transportation related measures as means of achieving the targets.</p>"

In developing the INDC, consideration has been given to Article 4.8 and 4.10 of the Convention; recognising Brunei Darussalam&rsquo;s economy is heavily dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the contributions that have been identified in this INDC are ambitious and highlight significant progression beyond historic and current undertakings. Delivery of the contributions will require major investments in new technologies, such as the promotion of renewable energy technologies that are not currently cost-competitive with fossil plant in Brunei Darussalam&rsquo;s, as well as changes in consumption behaviours of end-users. The main focus of the mitigation actions are currently on the energy sector, the largest sector in the country&rsquo;s economy; however equally ambitious targets have also been presented for the forestry - including increasing the already large areas of protected forest cover - highlighting the Government of Brunei Darussalam&rsquo;s clear objective to limit its net GHG emissions.</p> <p>As Brunei Darussalam&rsquo;s first National Communication and GHG emissions inventory are currently under development, quantified GHG reduction targets (or contributions) have not been provided in this version of the INDC.
