Eritrea also strongly urged concrete changes to be made to the procedures common in international funding, so that financial and technological support dedicated to climate change purposes would be accessible to eligible countries in a fair, non-discriminatory and transparent manner.<br /> Eritrea also added that, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities of all countries, it reiterates its unyielding commitment to undertake its obligations under the Convention. As a country that pollutes little but that is most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, it fully realizes that the success of its efforts for sustainable development will depend on properly addressing environmental issues. In this regard, Eritrea has been striving within its means and capacity to implement climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes.<br />"
