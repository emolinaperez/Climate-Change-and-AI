However, Papua New Guinea believes that the lack of finalized rules of procedure under the two-track negotiation process impedes progress and erodes ambition. Therefore, an urgent review must be undertaken by the Parties.<br /> Need for a legally binding treaty: the Party believes that global development and climate objectives are best realized through a legally binding and broadly inclusive international treaty framework that includes, inter alia: science-based global emission reduction targets, leadership by all developed countries related to deep domestic emission cuts and the provision of international support; NAMAs implemented by developing countries subject to their respective capabilities and the provision of adequate, predictable and sustainable international support (finance, capacity-building and technology); appropriate investments to support adaptation measures in developing countries; an effective system for measuring, monitoring, reporting and verification; and a robust compliance regime, etc.<br /> Delivery on pledges and potential: Papua New Guinea's support for the Copenhagen Accord is subject to the immediate mobilization and verification of the pledged USD 30 billion in financial resources from 2010 to 2012 and the rapid establishment of mechanism and governance systems to facilitate its effective implementation and distribution. Further, the Copenhagen Accord must deliver on its promise and potential, including: expanded commitments, actions and sources for emission reductions; an aggregate commitment leading to a peaking of emissions by 2020; the establishment of the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund; a coordinated increase in the funding commitment, building towards total funds of USD 100 billion or more by 2020; a refocus on effective implementation related to Africa, the LDCs, the small island developing States (SIDS) and forests (REDD-plus); and the transition to a framework that facilities a low-carbon economic transition at the national level.<br /> Enabling climate-compatible development: Papua New Guinea intends to finalize an initial Climate-compatible Development Plan designed to promote economic and social development in a manner that eradicates poverty, subject to Article 4, paragraphs 3 and 7, of the Convention and paragraph 2 of the Copenhagen Accord. Further, Papua New Guinea recognizes that NAMAs will be undertaken on the basis of its respective capability and will be further enabled by international support (financial, capacity-building and technological) that is new and additional, predictable and adequate, including voluntary actions by LDCs and SIDS taken on the basis of support as stipulated in paragraph 5 of the Copenhagen Accord. However, neither the Copenhagen Accord nor the draft AWG-LCA text adequately support frameworks for the delivery of finance based on country-led national climate-compatible development plans, thereby necessitating further review, consideration and guidance by the Parties.<br /> Periodic review and update: subject to ongoing national planning processes, Papua New Guinea expects to periodically update relevant sustainable development objectives, 'business as usual' projections, NAMAs, adaptation investments and the resulting requirements for enabling resource mobilization.<br /> Papua New Guinea also provided the following rationale for its support of the Copenhagen Accord.<br /> Commitments and actions covering 80 per cent of global emissions: for the first time, total commitments made by countries, including key sectors such as REDD-plus, represent almost 80 per cent of global emissions. Conversely, less than 25 per cent of global GHG emissions are now represented by signatories to Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol (11 Gt of 46 Gt in 2005).<br /> Potential for global emissions to peak by 2020: if the commitments pledged under the Copenhagen Accord are implemented to their maximum potential domestically in both developed and developing countries, these actions could lead to global emissions peaking by 2020. Conversely, under the Kyoto Protocol, this would be impossible due to technically unfeasible domestic reductions and/or financially unsustainable purchases of CDM offset credits.<br /> Commitment to limit global temperature rise: the Copenhagen Accord expresses a collective commitment to limit the increase in global temperature below 2 &deg;C while agreeing to consider by 2015 the strengthening of long-term goals to limit the temperature rise below 1.5 &deg;C. However, this will require participating Parties to perform at the maximum range or exceed existing commitments. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol cannot achieve a 2 &deg;C limit, let alone a 1.5 &deg;C limit, and will result in a 'business as usual' global temperature increase of 4 &deg;C.<br /> Focus on the most vulnerable: the Copenhagen Accord places appropriate emphasis on the developing countries that are most vulnerable and least able to adapt to the impacts of climate change from the dual metrics of adverse consequences and required economic transitions. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol has channelled less than 5 per cent of CDM resources (number of projects and pipeline credits) to those most vulnerable and least able to adapt, such as the LDCs, SIDS and Africa.<br /> Facilitating economic transformation: the Copenhagen Accord correctly approaches climate change from the perspective of economic transformation for developing countries, facilitated through incentives to develop along low emission pathways (paragraph 7 of the Copenhagen Accord) within the context of sustainable development. Similar policy advances must be incorporated within the outcomes of the AWG-LCA. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol only incentivizes project-oriented and programmatic activities which are insufficient to fulfil the ultimate objectives of the Convention.<br /> Increased funding to enable developing country mitigation: the Copenhagen Accord pledges approximately USD 30 billion from 2010 to 2012 or USD 10 billion per year, with a significant proportion to enable mitigation actions in developing countries. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol, under the primary CDM market, generated USD 6.5 billion in 2008. Therefore, the addition of the Copenhagen Accord, together with the ongoing CDM market, may provide significant and additional emission reductions in developing countries.<br /> Increased funding for adaptation: the Copenhagen Accord pledges approximately USD 30 billion from 2010 to 2012, or USD 10 billion per year; several billion of this total could potentially be used for adaptation actions in developing countries. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol, under the Adaptation Fund linked to the CDM, currently has at its disposal 7.5 million CERs (CDM credits), worth around USD 125 million.<br /> Legal mandate: the Copenhagen Accord operates under Article 7, paragraph 2(c), of the Convention and Papua New Guinea hereby requests the COP to facilitate the coordination of measures adopted by those Parties inscribing actions to address climate change and its effects, taking into account their differing circumstances, responsibilities and capabilities, and respective commitments.<br />"
