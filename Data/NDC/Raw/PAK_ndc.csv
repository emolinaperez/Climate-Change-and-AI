The country is passing through a unique phase of economic and social development, and is faced with grave challenges, including of a rapidly increasing population and threats to its food security and energy security. Therefore, a detailed analysis of future emissions is based on a wide range of probable scenarios in different sectors. Since GDP growth is considered to have a strong correlation with GHG emission pathways, particularly during the early developmental phase, it is imperative to establish a realistically credible GDP growth scenario for projecting the levels of GHG emission for this period. </p><p>The methodology for quantification of future emissions has been customized to integrate the multiple emerging factors, which historically has not been the practice in Pakistan. The quantification of future emissions based on the 'business as usual' scenario is, however, not consistent with future economic growth and developmental objectives of Pakistan. Hence, the methodology has been suitably adjusted to cater for the emerging needs and the forthcoming parameters in the developmental planning of Pakistan. </p><p>The Vision 2025 document of the Government of Pakistan sets a target of average GDP growth rate of 7 percent until the year 2025, which has been used for the extended period until 2030.

Based on this adjusted GDP growth rate, the sectoral growth rates have been calculated, thereby providing the sector-specific basis for quantification of the projected sectoral emissions till the year 2030. Although historical sectoral growth rates have been duly considered, the parameters for future scenarios are considered to be more relevant. </p><p>In an endeavor to fully incorporate possible future prospects and also to undertake the analytical exercise, possible scenarios of emissions growth have been prepared with due care. This helped analyze the overall emissions trajectory on a broad spectrum with comprehensive perspective, leading to the final emissions numbers.
