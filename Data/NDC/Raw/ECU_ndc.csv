Actors from public, private, academic, non-governmental, research and other sectors have been consulted. Dialogues, workshops and technical meetings have been held to identify those aspects that require additional financial resources for their implementation but also those that are within the national capacity to be implemented without additional resources and as a product, measures and goals have been defined that will be implemented with the participation of sectoral entities, private companies.</p><p>Additionally, it should be noted that the actions that have been identified as part of the NDC have a national coverage and it is visualized that their implementation includes actors at all levels of the state. At the same time, these actions have been disaggregated by sectors in line with the National Climate Change Strategy, which has implied a commitment by the sector actors at various levels, positioning the theme of climate change on the agenda of all instances.</p><p>For these reasons, and for the series of measures and lines of action identified, this first NDC of Ecuador is undoubtedly ambitious and fair in the face of its national circumstances as a developing country, its international commitments and responsibilities and takes a robust step towards a implementation of medium and long-term measures in the country for the fight against climate change.</p>"

However, a potential for reducing emissions even further in the energy sector, to a level between 37.5 and 45.8% with respect to the BAU baseline has also been calculated. This potential could be harnessed in light of the appropriate circumstances in terms of availability of resources and support offered by the international community. This is a second scenario dependent upon international support and will translate into a per capita emissions reduction in 2025 of 40% below the BAU levels.""</p>"
