The United States will undertake a comprehensive, land-based approach that takes advantage of the broadest array of mitigation actions <br /> The United States stated in their 2012 submission that comprehensive emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector will be accounted using a net-net approach and a 2005 base year, including a production approach to account for harvested wood products. Methodological approaches for excluding emissions resulting from non-anthropogenic natural disturbances are under consideration. The Party acknowledges that, in accordance with the full land-based approach, LULUCF contributed around 1,057 Mt CO2 eq net removals in 2005, which is around 15 per cent of the total emissions from all other sectors.

23276194,"Pledges","USA","United States","Overview","Overview of Commitment",NA,NA,"pledge_content","Pledge content","The United States communicated a target in the range of a 17 per cent emission reduction by 2020 compared with 2005 levels, in conformity with anticipated United States energy and climate legislation, recognizing that the final target will be reported to the secretariat in the light of the enacted legislation. In addition, the pathway set forth in pending legislation would entail a 30 per cent emission reduction by 2025 and a 42 per cent emission reduction by 2030, in line with the goal to reduce emissions by 83 per cent by 2050. The submission of the target by the United States was made on the assumption that other Annex I Parties, as well as more advanced non-Annex I Parties, would, by 31 January 2010, associate with the Copenhagen Accord and submit mitigation actions for compilation into an information document in accordance with paragraph 4 or 5 of the Accord, as the case may be."
