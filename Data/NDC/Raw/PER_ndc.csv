It also stated that its mitigation actions listed above are voluntary in nature and are guided by the principles and provisions of the Convention, especially Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 7, Article 12, paragraphs 1(b) and 4, and Article 10, paragraph 2(a).<br /> Peru also stated that its mitigation measures do not exclude the use of the CDM or other market-based mechanisms which could be created under the Convention. It added that for the development and implementation of its mitigation actions it requires support from the international community through the range of financial and cooperative mechanisms available.<br /> Peru made a second submission to the secretariat on 25 July 2011, providing additional information.<br /> On 9 July 2011, the Government approved a national plan of environmental action for 2010-2021, which established goals and actions incorporating the following commitments to achieve a national low-carbon economy:<br /> <br /> (a) Reducing net emissions from the LULUCF sector through the conservation of 208,500 square miles of primary forests as part of its National Programme of Forest Conservation. This programme, combined with additional actions, will allow Peru to achieve an emission reduction of 45 per cent compared with the emission level in 2000, with potential avoided emissions of up to 50 Mt CO2 eq;<br /> <br /> (b) Using non-conventional renewable energies and hydropower to provide at least 40 per cent of the total energy mix. Together with energy efficiency, this initiative will result in a total emission reduction of 28 per cent compared with the emission level in 2000, with potential avoided emissions of up to 7 Mt CO2 eq;<br /> <br /> (c) Capturing and using CH4 from urban solid waste: a national programme to build landfills in 31 large and medium-sized cities, with the potential to achieve an emission reduction of 7 Mt CO2 eq.<br /> Peru reiterated that it will require support from the international community through the financial and cooperation mechanisms established by the COP to implement the above-mentioned actions.<br />"
