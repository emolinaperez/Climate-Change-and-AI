23276227,"Pledges","ISR","Israel","Overview","Overview of Commitment",NA,NA,"pledge_content","Pledge content","Israel communicated that it will strive to achieve the target of a 20 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2020 below 'business as usual' levels.<br /> It added that this goal would be achieved primarily through the implementation of two government decisions by 2020, one calling for a 10 per cent share of renewable energy in electricity generation and the other calling for a 20 per cent reduction in electricity consumption.<br /> Israel also communicated that an inter-ministerial steering committee will prepare a national action plan, which will include, inter alia: the reduction potential of various defined measures; means of implementation; implementation barriers; economic aspects of the long-term plan; and a timetable for its implementation.<br /> Israel made a second submission on 13 August 2012, providing the additional information presented below.<br /> It communicated that a study conducted in 2009 found that, under a 'business as usual' scenario, Israel's GHG emissions are expected to double between 2005 and 2030. This situation is primarily due to Israel's relatively high growth in population and the continuous increase in the standard of living. The results pointed to a 63 per cent increase in the country's GHG emissions by 2025, stemming largely from an increase in fuel combustion in the energy sector. As the energy sector is the major contributor to Israel's GHG emissions, the study focused mainly on expected developments in that sector.<br /> Israel also communicated information on its national circumstances, stating that the relatively low abatement potential in the country is due to: the low feasibility of many abatement measures, such as the absence of heavy industry; the low feasibility of biomass and carbon capture and storage; and land scarcity.<br /> Israel stated that the following main actions are budgeted for and expected to be implemented: <br /> <br /> (a) The development of a programme for the scrapping of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners in the household sector, replacing them with energy-efficient models;<br /> <br /> (b) The promotion of pilot projects for new and existing green buildings, including a building survey, and an experimental project for retrofitting insulation in existing buildings within the framework of the Government's urban renewal project;<br /> <br /> (c) Investment in education and information projects to increase awareness and promote behavioural changes among the public in order to achieve energy efficiency and GHG emission reductions; <br /> <br /> (d) Investment in the commercial integration of Israeli technologies aimed at reducing GHG emissions<br /> In addition, Israel provided information on a government-sponsored programme of subsidies to be provided to the industrial, commercial and municipal sectors for GHG emission reduction projects. The programme will provide a total subsidy of up to 10 million new sheqalim (USD 2.5 million) or up to 20 per cent of the total investment to eligible projects that deliver quantified reductions in GHG emissions until at least 2020.<br /> An inter-ministerial committee of all relevant ministries, headed by the Director General of the Finance Ministry, was set up to specify the steps required for the implementation of the national action plan.<br /> During 2013, procedures for tracking progress in the implementation of the national plan will be established. The monitoring results will be reported to the Government by the Minister of Environmental Protection at the end of each year.<br /> Finally, Israel will commission a new cost-benefit analysis to examine the potential for reducing GHG emissions after 2020. It will provide the basis for a long-term strategy for reducing emissions. Further, a national MRV system will be established to track the implementation of the national plan for the reduction of GHG emissions, as well as to track all additional government measures implemented for the reduction of GHG emissions.<br />"
