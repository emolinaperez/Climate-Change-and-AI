Algeria also added that the emission reductions of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) must be significant, given their historical responsibility, and that the Annex I Parties that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol should be part of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Further, the Party stated that the efforts to achieve the worldwide goal of reducing GHG emissions should be equitably borne by allowing developing countries access to atmospheric space for their social and economic development.<br /> <br /> Algeria stated that NAMAs should be voluntary in nature and included in national communications. With respect to funding, Algeria stated that the Accord provides for developed country Parties to support the actions of developing countries in fighting climate change, which implies individualized commitments from developed countries, as well as the fair representation of developing countries in the international governance system for managing the funds."
