23226582,"CAIT","MKD","Macedonia","Overview","Fairness and Ambition",NA,NA,"ambition","Description of ambition","“Following the Talanoa Call for Action, launched by the Presidents of COP 23 and COP 24, the Republic of North Macedonia made its NDC (2020) more ambitious than NDC (2015) (i) articulating the target of 51% reduction in GHG emissions of 2030 compared to 1990 level, instead of 30% deviation from BAU in 2030, and (ii) maintaining the pace of the “ratchet-up mechanism”.<br>National commitments are well in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 that correspond to long term goal of the Paris Agreement. It is further important to note that the evolving nature of a country’s circumstances is to be reflected in the consideration of fairness through the following indicators:<ul><li>Responsibility reflected in a country’s past and current GHG emissions.: 1) County’s emissions (2016) as percentage of World emissions (2016): 0.022%, 2) Country’s per capita emissions (2016) as percentage of World per capita emissions (2016): 79%, 3) Country’s historical emissions (cumulative 1990-2016) as percentage of World emissions (cumulative 1990-2016): 0.032%</li><li>Ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures (capacity to contribute to solving the climate change problem): 1) GDP growth level: North Macedonia lags behind the Southeast Europe (SEE) average, as well as the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). As projected by the International Monetary Fund and Ministry of Finance, until 2040 the Macedonian real GDP growth rate will grow at an average rate of 3.3%., 2) GDP per capita: Such GDP growth rate could be expected for a developing country, and should lead to convergence towards levels of GDP per capita that are common for developed CEE countries today.</li><li>The mitigation potential and costs: 1) The economic and environmental analyses (MAC curve) has estimated the total reduction in 2030 at 5.6 Tg CO2-eq (achievable if all the proposed PAMs are implemented as planned). 70% of the reduction can be achieved with negative costs (with PAMs of “win-win” type which are two thirds of all PAMs). Furthermore, additional 20% of the reduction can be realized by PAMs with specific costs in the range 0 - 5 €/t CO2-eq. Hence, there is relatively high mitigation potential which can be harnessed with cost-effective PAMs. This makes economic case of decarbonization pathway being cheaper than current policy pathway.</li></ul><br>The investments needed for realization of the decarbonization scenario are estimated at 7.7% of the total average annual GDP. As indicated in the sectoral action plans, beside domestic investments, the country would count on international support (international funds, donors, banks) which will contribute towards adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of North Macedonia towards a low-carbon economy, enhancing further the decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of real GDP per capita. Along with the international financial support, the country will also need assistance in the form of technology transfer and capacity building.”"

PAMs with the highest share in the number of new domestic green jobs are: Retrofit of existing residential buildings (42%), Construction of passive houses (21%), RES without incentives (6%) and Solar thermal collectors (8%).</li><li>Gender: Based on the types of the newly created jobs, very basic analysis indicated that at least 27% of the jobs in 2035 can be assigned to women. Furthermore, the PAMs were analyzed in light of their gender responsiveness. It was found that there are number of PAMs where gender disaggregated approach would improve the implementation, particularly the PAMs related to subsidizing mitigation technologies and awareness rising. Subsequently, with an aim to make the enhanced NDC gender-responsive, the respective PAMs were redesigned and gender indictors included. Most prominent example is redesign of the “first come, first served” subsidy model to a gender informed model that supported 10,000 most vulnerable households in most affected cities in the country to replace their heating technology with more efficient one.</li></ul><br>Sustainable Development Goals: ""Aiming at understanding the contribution of the enhanced NDC to the national SD agenda, the SCAN tool and the newly developed Q-SCAN tool were applied to identify and quantify their synergies and trade-offs. Figure 3 depicts the aggregated synergies and trade-offs of three sectors from the enhanced NDC - Electricity & heat, Transport, Buildings. The pattern of the integral scores follows the pattern of the sector Electricity & Heat, which indicates that this sector is dominant in influencing the SDGs. The strongest synergies remain with SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth due to the new job opportunities in renewable energy deployment and in the construction and retrofit market; sustained economic growth, improved economic efficiency per unit of product and sustained support of entrepreneurship. The most significant trade-off is with the SDG 15 Life on land, due to the land requirements from renewable energy projects, potential forest degradation and potential river routes changes. However, the highest synergies are almost three times stronger than the highest trade-offs."""
