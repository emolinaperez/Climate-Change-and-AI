The following actions are expected to be implemented:<br /> <br /> (a) The quantification of GHG emission levels under different farming management practices, with a view to enhancing the development of national carbon accounting; <br /> <br /> (b) Changes in agricultural practices and systems, including integrated pest management, crop rotation, conservation agriculture, post-harvest handling and storage, water harvesting, watershed management, soil and water conservation, and irrigation;<br /> <br /> (c) The enhancement of participatory research and technology development in relation to the production and management of crops, livestock and fisheries and land and water management; <br /> <br /> (d) The development of agricultural advisory services and information systems focusing on participatory extension approaches;<br /> <br /> (e) The strengthening of local and farmers' institutions and organizations;<br /> <br /> (f) The promotion of microfinance schemes, including ensuring functioning financial markets and institutions;<br /> <br /> (g) Increased focus on risk sharing and risk reduction across the entire value chain;<br /> <br /> (h) The development/enhancement of climate information systems and early warning mechanisms;<br /> <br /> (i) The review and harmonization of the existing policies and regulations that deal with climate change related impacts;<br /> <br /> (j) The mainstreaming of win-win adaptation and mitigation strategies and actions through appropriate incentives;<br /> <br /> (k) Building the capacity to develop, implement and monitor agricultural NAMAs;<br /> <br /> (l) The scaling up of best practices that enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation.<br /> With regard to waste management, the following actions are planned:<br /> <br /> (a) The construction of controlled landfills and capacity-building for the operation of the landfills;<br /> <br /> (b) The processing of solid and liquid municipal and agricultural waste into energy and organic fertilizer;<br /> <br /> (c) Reducing the generation of waste;<br /> <br /> (d) Composting;<br /> <br /> (e) Mechanical-biological treatment;<br /> <br /> (f) The disposal of waste in sanitary landfills.<br /> With regard to energy, the following actions are planned:<br /> <br /> (a) The promotion of renewable energy technologies;<br /> <br /> (b) The construction of biogas digesters;<br /> <br /> (c) The use of efficient lighting technologies; <br /> <br /> (d) The use of efficient firewood cooking stoves; <br /> <br /> (e) Increasing efficiency in relation to the capacity and energy balances of the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi;<br /> <br /> (f) Increasing the ethanol-to-petrol blending ratio;<br /> <br /> (g) Switching from paraffin (kerosene) lamps to photovoltaic lamps.<br /> With regard to LULUCF, the following actions are planned:<br /> <br /> (a) Expanding the stands of trees and the pool of carbon in wood products; <br /> <br /> (b) Maintaining the existing stands of trees and the proportion of forest products currently in use.<br /> With regard to industrial processes, the following actions are planned:<br /> <br /> (a) The development of environmental standards; <br /> <br /> (b) The voluntary engagement of programme regulators with firms so as to share and disseminate information and expertise interactively;<br /> <br /> (c) The use of market-based instruments, such as the administration of taxes, tariffs and subsidies;<br /> <br /> (d) Transparent reporting by firms of the pollutants discharged from their processes;<br /> <br /> (e) Information, education and public-awareness campaigns on the risks of pollutants for human health and the environment;<br /> <br /> (f) The use of carbon capture and storage; <br /> <br /> (g) The use of technologies that blend cement with rice husks; <br /> <br /> (h) The promotion of industries that use CO2 as a raw material; <br /> <br /> (i) The promotion of industries that add value to lime via the Solvay process.<br /> Finally, Malawi communicated that international support will be needed in the form of finance, technology and capacity-building to implement the NAMAs listed above.<br />"
