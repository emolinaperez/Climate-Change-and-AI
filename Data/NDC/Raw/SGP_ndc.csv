Although a legally binding agreement has yet to be achieved, Singapore will nonetheless begin to implement the mitigation and energy efficiency measures announced under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint in April 2009. These measures are an integral part of the measures to achieve a 16 per cent reduction below 'business as usual' levels. When a legally binding global agreement on climate change is reached, Singapore will implement additional measures to achieve the full 16 per cent reduction below 'business as usual' levels in 2020."
