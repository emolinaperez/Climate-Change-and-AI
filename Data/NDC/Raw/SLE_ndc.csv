It aims to increase conservation efforts through: <br /> <br /> &bull; The establishment of a network of 12 protected areas by 2015; <br /> <br /> &bull; The sustainable management and protection of forest reserves and catchment areas, including mangroves, and coastal and inland wetlands; <br /> <br /> &bull; The delineation and restoration of vulnerable habitats and ecosystems in the west of Sierra Leone; <br /> <br /> &bull; The provision of support for a national assessment of forest resources; <br /> <br /> (c) The improvement of forest governance to maintain the proportion of land area covered by forests to at least 3.4 million ha by 2015, through the development of legislation, regulations and by-laws for environmental protection, including the control of deforestation, firewood collection and charcoal production, and through capacity-building, training and support for law enforcement services and the Ministry of Agriculture (Forestry Department); <br /> <br /> (d) The setting/development of air, water and soil quality standards, and ensuring regular assessments and monitoring through control programmes;<br /> <br /> (e) The introduction of conservation farming and the promotion of the use of other sustainable agricultural practices (e.g. agroforestry);<br /> <br /> (f) The development of an Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Programme, including sustainable land management programmes, particularly in relation to ecosystems;<br /> <br /> (g) The expansion of clean energy utilization (e.g. solar, mini-hydroelectric power, LPG, biomass stoves);<br /> <br /> (h) The development of energy efficiency programmes through sensitization and awareness-raising campaigns. The sustainable production of charcoal and the reduction of dependence on firewood;<br /> <br /> (i) The development of alternative energy sources, such as biofuels from sugarcane, corn, rice husks, etc.;<br /> <br /> (j) The development of agricultural and urban waste incineration programmes for energy production;<br /> <br /> (k) Improved waste management through the composting and recycling of waste; <br /> <br /> (l) The development and enforcement of regulations on the regular maintenance of vehicles. Improving the use of mass transport (e.g. road and water) for passengers and cargo in order to reduce traffic congestion and GHG emissions.<br />"
