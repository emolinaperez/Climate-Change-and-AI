These factors are briefly explained here below. </p><p>Iceland&lsquo;s electricity production and heating comes almost 100% from renewable energy, with minimal emissions.

However, adaptation measures will also be needed, in order to tackle the unavoidable impacts that will accompany higher temperatures and associated changes. Impacts of climate change on Iceland include receding glaciers, expanding woodlands, changes in sea level (higher levels in some parts, but lower in other), warming seas with changes in species distributions, and increased risks of many types of natural disasters. Of particular concern is ocean acidification and its possible impact on marine life and fisheries. Work is currently under way for a national adaptation strategy due to be finalized in 2021."""
