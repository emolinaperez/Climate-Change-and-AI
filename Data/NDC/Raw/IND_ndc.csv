In terms of the provision on Article 3.1 and 4.7, this submission by India represents the utmost ambitious action in the current state of development. Both in terms of cumulative global emissions (only 3%) and per capita emission (1.56 tCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2010), India&rsquo;s contribution to the problem of climate change is limited but its actions are fair and ambitious.&nbsp;</p> <p>The recent decisions of the Government represent a quantum jump in our aspirations in climate change actions starting with the manifold scaling up of our renewable energy targets to the programme on Smart Cities, cleaning of rivers and Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission). The initiatives have demonstrated unparalleled vision and strong political initiatives of the Government. It is expected that developed countries will re-examine their pre 2020 actions in the light of substantial action taken by developing countries like India to ensure that the ambition gap is substantially bridged.</p> <p>Through this INDC, India has shown its commitment to combat climate change and these actions are indeed important contributions to the global effort. However, our efforts to avoid emissions during our development process are also tied to the availability and level of international financing and technology transfer since India still faces complex developmental challenges. The critical issue for developing nations is the gap between their equitable share of the global carbon space and the actual share of carbon space that will be accessible to them. The transfer of appropriate technologies and provision of adequate finance will have to be a determined contribution of the developed countries, which will further enable the developing countries to accomplish and even enhance their efforts. It is expected that developed countries would recognize that without means of implementation and adequate resources, the global vision is but a vacant dream. Addressing the United Nations Summit for the adoption of Post-2015 Development Agenda in September 2015, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi said; &ldquo;We should forge a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all. Equally, we must look for changes in our lifestyles that would make us less dependent on energy and more sustainable in our consumption. It is equally critical to launch a global education programme that prepares our next generation to protect and conserve Nature. I hope that the Developed World will fulfil its financing commitments for development and climate change, without in any way putting both under the same head&rdquo;.</p> <p>India&rsquo;s INDC is fair and ambitious considering the fact that India is attempting to work towards low carbon emission pathway while endeavoring to meet all the developmental challenges the country faces today. Through this submission, India intends to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 % by 2030 from 2005 level. This commitment is further echoed in India&rsquo;s actions in climate change adaptation with setting up its own &lsquo;National Adaptation Fund&rsquo;.</p> <p>The current policy framework also includes a favorable environment for a rapid increase in renewable energy, move towards low carbon sustainable development pathway and adapting to the impacts of climate change. It represents the highest possible efforts as evident from the multiple initiatives of the Government of India.</p> <p>Accordingly, India&rsquo;s development plans will continue to lay a balanced emphasis on economic development and environment.""</p>"
