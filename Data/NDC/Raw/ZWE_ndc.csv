The country is a net carbon sink with a high potential sequestration capacity owing to its forests that cover 45% of the total land area.</p><p>The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) projected that the average per capita energy CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the Non-Annex I regions will vary from 2.8 to 5.1 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq per capita by 2030 (IPCC, 2007). The Zimbabwean per capita emissions is projected to be 3.0 and 2.3 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq in 2030 for the BAU and with mitigation respectively. Zimbabwe has a low per capita emission because of its low energy per capita consumption. The electricity consumption per capita of 944 kWh in 2000 dropped to 666 kWh in 2012 and is projected to be around 1,271 kWh in 2030. This means that the national energy consumption has to increase.</p><p>Despite its low emissions and high carbon sequestration potential, Zimbabwe is already working towards universal access to cleaner energy by 2030. Below are some of the clean energy initiatives under consideration:</p><p>- Replacing more than a million incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to more than 164,654 houses saving 42 MW.</p><p>- Recognising and rewarding companies making efforts in the area of energy efficiency and carbon footprint as a way of promoting good behaviour.</p><p>- Stepwise increase in Kariba Power Station (hydro power plant) from 666 to 750 MW and then 1050MW. Work on this plant is underway.</p><p>- Promoting the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the substitute for or alternative to grid electricity.
