Starting on March 2016, the National Cabinet of Climate Change became fully functional (Decree 891/2016), grouping 12 ministries. This decision allowed having an instance of participation, review and high level political validation to agree on measures over which the reviewed NDC was built upon. The cabinet coordinates its work in thematic sectorial meetings (energy, agriculture and forests, waste, transport and industry) as well as in transversal meetings (awareness and education, adaptation and finance). It also includes a formal instance of participation for the provinces through COFEMA and non-governmental organisms (NGOs), work associations, private, academic and scientific sectors and municipalities through the Extended Table of the National Cabinet of Climate Change.<br>The Cabinet agreed to present the result of the work carried out throughout the year as a revised contribution, without interrupting the pending tasks to continue increasing the ambition and improving the inventory and monitoring systems, to be presented in the future under the form of a new NDC.<br>The current revision of the contribution incorporates the results of the review of the measures of the national contribution, as well as the results of the 2014 second Biennial Update Report (BUR), done with the IPCC 2006 methodology. That allowed improving the methodological consistency of the NDC by showing, among other things, the particularities of the agricultural practices used in Argentina.<br>At the same time, the government worked alongside the National Congress for the fast approval of the Paris Agreement, accomplishing a wide support by the majority of the lawmakers of all the political parties (Law 27.270 passed on September 1st 2016). By depositing the ratification instrument on September 21, 2016, Argentina contributed to the rapid entry into force of the Agreement.</p>"

Based on such studies the following indexes were taken into account in order to measure, in relative terms, the values of the following reviewed NDC:</p><p><strong>(a) The participation of Argentina in global emissions compared to its participation in the efforts offered for global reduction at present:</strong> The participation of the Argentine Republic in the global emissions of GHGs in 2014 was of 0.7% of the total global emissions. Argentina&rsquo;s reviewed mitigation contribution represents a participation of 2.8% of the country over the total amount of unconditional reductions informed by the Parties of UNFCCC (sum of submitted contributions). In such sense, Argentina`s reviewed contribution, compared to the unconditional contributions of the rest of the countries, is four times its current participation in the global emissions, thus showing its ambitious level.</p><p><strong>(b) Argentina&rsquo;s participation in the global emissions compared to its participation in the needed efforts to achieve the goal of 2&ordm;C in the future:</strong> If all the unconditional measures accounted in the present NDC were implemented, the contribution of the Argentina to the needed global effort for the year 2030 in order to achieve the goal of maintaining the temperature increase below 2&ordm;C regarding preindustrial levels would be very close to the proportion of its current emissions (0,6% of the reductions compared to 0,7% of the emissions). This indicator shows the justice of the presented goal, and the reasonability of the decision of continuing with the revision process of the mitigation measures that compose the NDC, in order to adequately contribute to the global effort needed to achieve the climate goals of the Agreement, identifying new actions which shall be duly informed as part of the national contribution presented before the UNFCCC.</p><p><strong>(c) Argentina&rsquo;s participation in global emissions, compared to its participation in the needed efforts to achieve the goal of 2&ordm;C in the future if it were to implement all conditional planned measures: </strong>If all conditional measures included in the NDC were implemented, the contribution of Argentina to the needed global effort for 2030 of achieving the goal of keeping the temperature below 2&ordm;C regarding preindustrial levels will almost duplicate its proportion of current emissions (1,3% of the reductions compared to the 0,7% of the emissions). That would demonstrate its capacity of contributing with the necessary global ambition through the implementation of the identified conditional measures.""</p>"

23276198,"Pledges","ARG","Argentina","Overview","Overview of Commitment",NA,NA,"pledge_content","Pledge content","Argentina communicated that it is currently developing programmes and NAMAs, supported by a strong regulatory framework in the sectors of, inter alia, energy efficiency, renewable energy, biofuels, forest management and solid waste management, which are expected to have a direct and positive effect on the reduction of GHG emissions, thereby contributing to the ultimate objective of the Convention. Additional information on the Party's sector-specific actions is provided below:<br /> <br /> (a) Energy efficiency: Decree No. 140/07 created the National Programme for the Rational Use of Energy and Energy Efficiency, which incentivizes the rational use of electricity and natural gas through economic incentives for reducing consumption; Law No. 26473 forbids, since 31 December 2010, the commercialization of incandescent light bulbs in the country; and various national programmes have also been established, such as the Programme for Increasing Energy and Production Efficiency in Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises, the Programme for the Quality of Electric Appliances, and the Programme for Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings; <br /> <br /> (b) Renewable energy: Law No. 26190 offers subsidies for electricity generation from renewable energy resources such as wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), mini-hydro, biogas and biomass, establishing tax exemptions to incentivize investment in the sector. Under this framework, the state-owned company ENARSA (Energ&iacute;a Argentina S.A.) is developing wind projects with a total capacity of 500 MW, as well as the Programme for Renewable Energy for the Rural Market and Law No. 26123 for the Promotion of Hydrogen;<br /> <br /> (c) Biofuels: the National Programme on Biofuels and Law No. 26093, which since January 2010 establishes a minimum share of 5 per cent of bioethanol and biodiesel in the gasoline and diesel oil sold in the country, provide a tax exemption and incremental prices for biofuel producers;<br /> <br /> (d) Forest management: Law No. 26331 establishes rules for the use of land and for the rational and sustainable management of native forest and provides financial support to the provinces to compensate for potential short-term losses; Law No. 26432 promotes investment in new forest enterprises and the enlargement of existing forests; <br /> <br /> (e) Solid waste management: the National Plan for the Integral Management of Urban Solid Waste is supported by a loan from the World Bank for the construction of sanitary landfills and landfill gas capture.<br /> <br /> Argentina stated that COP 16/CMP 6 (the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol) would be the next opportunity to achieve efficient and effective actions so that, in the process of transformation towards a low-carbon society, developing countries could be provided with the financial, technological and scientific means to strengthen their sustainable development processes. This, the communication continued, is the fundamental basis, in conjunction with legally binding commitments for emission reductions by developed countries, from which to advance the process at the required accelerated pace.<br /> <br /> Argentina also stated that the implementation of NAMAs by developing countries will contribute to the global process of the reduction of emissions, based on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and according to the principles and provisions of the Convention, particularly Article 4, paragraphs 1, 7 and 8."
