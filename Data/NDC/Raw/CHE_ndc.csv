However, using the rules under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and applying the accounting approach of the forest management reference level, emissions or removals from forest management in Switzerland are estimated to be zero in 2020. <br /> Reporting of LULUCF under the Convention follows a comprehensive land- based approach. In the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Switzerland is accounting for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, of the Kyoto Protocol and forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4. Accounting for additional activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, of the Kyoto Protocol in the second commitment period is yet to be decided"

The estimate of the amount of carbon credits to be used is not available yet. The Swiss CO2 Law for the 2013-2020 period defines Switzerland's -20 per cent target as domestic; however, carbon credits are planned to be used in some limited cases.* In accordance with the same law, in addition to the carbon credits that will be used for achieving the -20 per cent target, such credits are also planned to be used for up to 75 per cent of the additional emission reductions beyond the -20 per cent target by 2020 compared with 1990. Switzerland does not support the use of AAUs outside of the Kyoto system. <br /> *In its submission, Switzerland lists the following cases: Ðfossil fuel power plants, the ETS, companies exempted from the CO2 levy that are not involved in the ETS, and the sanction mechanismÓ."
