The Party further stated that it makes this commitment because it believes that there is no greater need than the need to keep the planet safe in order to sustain life and that all Parties, large or small, can play a part in keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 &deg;C. While making this sincere commitment, Bhutan calls upon the global community to come forward and work towards a legally binding treaty under the guiding principles and commitments of the Convention.<br /> <br /> Bhutan also communicated that, in its efforts to remain carbon-neutral and to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, it will require the support of the international community, the details of which it will communicate at a later date."
