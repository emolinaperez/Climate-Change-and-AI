23276224,"Pledges","GIN","Guinea","Overview","Overview of Commitment",NA,NA,"pledge_content","Pledge content","Guinea communicated proposals for a framework for the development of two NAMAs: one in the energy sector and one in the agriculture sector.<br /> The first proposal involves the development of energy generation from renewable sources, with a time frame for implementation of five years. Guinea communicated that 37 per cent of its GHG emissions come from energy production and use in the country and that substituting thermal electricity generation for photovoltaic systems and/or hydroelectricity would reduce growth in emissions, which is expected to double by 2020. The project implementation would improve access to energy in rural areas and avoid significant levels of GHG emissions.<br /> The main activities include:<br /> <br /> (a) The development of an action plan for decentralized renewable energy electrification; <br /> <br /> (b) Supporting research into accelerating the use of renewable energy; <br /> <br /> (c) The construction of a few multi-purpose microdams.<br /> Guinea stated that partners for implementation identified include the Ministry of Energy and Environment, private-sector entities, research institutions, and international organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the Global Environment Facility.<br /> The second proposal involves the development of a NAMA for the intensification of agriculture and livestock production, with a time frame for implementation of five years. According to Guinea's second national communication, the agriculture sector is the primary source of GHG emissions in the country.<br /> The main activities include:<br /> <br /> (a) The intensification of agriculture and livestock production; <br /> <br /> (b) The promotion of agroforestry; <br /> <br /> (c) The development of sustainable farming; <br /> <br /> (d) Building the capacity to undertake improved techniques and the development of positive endogenous technologies.<br /> Guinea stated that the implementation of the second proposal would achieve the objective of the New Partnership for Africa's Development of a 6 per cent increase in the share of agriculture in gross domestic product, achieve food security, promote food self-sufficiency and facilitate the export of surpluses.<br /> Further, it was communicated that Guinea will require support from the international community to implement its NAMAs.<br />"
