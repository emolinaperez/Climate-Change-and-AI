Political guidance has been sought from the highest institutional level within the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. MOECAF has acted as INDC focal point, facilitating the inputs from other line ministries. The INDC has been prepared through the review of key documents and a government drafting and validation process with all line ministries, which included: one kick-off meeting in March-April 2015, which highlighted priority areas; three interministerial consultations between April and July 2015 (which refined possible options), and a final validation workshop in August 2015. In addition, specific advanced technical meetings were conducted in priority sectors such as the Ministries of Environmental Conservation and Forestry; Energy, Electric Power, Rail Transportation, Transport, Agriculture and Irrigation, Science and Technology, Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement and Industry. Following the consultation process a final round of ministerial consultations was carried out by MOECAF before the INDC was submitted to the Union Government&rsquo; cabinet for approval before submission to the UNFCCC. MOECAF also worked with the MCCA for technical facilitation of the process.</p> <p>Technical assistance for the development of the INDC has been received from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and delivered by Ricardo-AEA Ltd of the UK, and MCCA. Financial support by the Global Environment Facility via the UNEP and technical advice provided by UNEP-DTU partnership was also received to facilitate the preparation of the INDC.""</p> <p><strong>Implementation Plan </strong></p> <p>""Five main aspects are crucial for successful implementation of the INDC, and international support is required for each aspect. The first is the development of a clear strategy and co-ordination plan which assigns responsibilities and sets deadlines for activities. The second and third, are separate needs assessments for mitigation and adaptation activities respectively which have to be carried out to identify specific requirements and gaps in technology, finance and to identify capacity building requirements in both areas. This has been detailed out in section 5 - Means of implementation. Fourth, mobilising resources for policy development, identification and purchase of suitable technologies for planned actions will be required. Implementation of projects can then begin and finally the fifth aspect of the plan will need to be implemented; a monitoring system will assist with the implementation of the plan at many stages, as outlined below.</p> <p>A costing exercise including considering short, medium and long term priorities will be conducted to ensure the implementation plan has the necessary resources to deliver on intended contributions, intended actions and future policy development. The coordination of different ministries and stakeholders will be needed at all stages to successfully implement the plan.</p> <p>Therefore, for implementation, the following activities will be necessary:</p> <ul> <li>The Union Government&rsquo;s cabinet will identify and mandate one of the existing national interministerial committees to supervise and foster the implementation of the INDC.

MOECAF will assist relevant ministries to identify what is needed to implement identified mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as to develop Myanmar&rsquo;s ability to attract climate finance. MOECAF&rsquo;s role will also be to assist with the monitoring of the progress achieved by the line ministries in charge of the respective proposed actions and sectoral strategies outlined in the INDC.</li> <li>Myanmar would like to put in place a monitoring framework so that the selected national committee, through its ministry focal-point, will be able to further define financial and technical means of implementation most accurately, to measure progress on a regular basis and to issue policy guidance to the respective line ministries as needed. Myanmar recognises that high quality Measurement, Reporting and Verification-MRV system is the cornerstone of project management as it demonstrates progress against plans, allows responsible entities to steer activities to achieve set policy goals and provides valuable lessons for improving future design and implementation of activities. The set-up of an MRV system for Myanmar&rsquo;s INDC implementation will require the clear allocation of responsibilities, e.g.to the implementing agency concerned, the building of capacities within the relevant agency and relevant stakeholders providing data or performing other MRV activities is also necessary. The set-up of clear processes for data collection, evaluation, quality assurance and quality control, reporting and documentation/ archiving. These activities will require international support in the form of capacity building and financing. Where possible, Myanmar will use existing institutional structures, capacities and processes as a basis for this MRV system.</li> <li>The MRV system will have to include a component on costs and financial analysis.
