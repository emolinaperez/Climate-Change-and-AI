The update of the NDC contribution emerges as an intermediate milestone for this work, identifying the results of planning towards 2030, which is consistent with the long-term vision. This has made it possible to reach a common understanding on the methodology, sources of information, simulation tools and decision criteria used for both."

It stated that, since its first submission, the Government of Chile has been working to identify policies and programmes that could be developed into NAMAs. The Government has made an effort to gather information on potential NAMAs and, to that end, developed a template to specify the critical information for enabling the effective implementation of such NAMAs. The information included: an analysis of the potential emission reductions; the costs of implementation; and a suggested framework for measuring, reporting and verifying the resulting emission reductions. Several ministries have started to gather the information, which is from national and international studies. Chile mentioned that it would like the information generated through the process to help it to obtain national and/or international financing for the implementation of its NAMAs.<br />"
