This includes supporting sectors with the planning and implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions, the assessment and communication of financing and support needs (nationally and internationally), and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) related to NDC implementation. It will involve further mainstreaming of mitigation and adaptation within economic development, promoting mitigation and adaptation actions, improving cooperation among ministries, and mobilising support for mitigation and adaptation actions. </p><p>MRV of NDC implementation will include tracking the implementation of mitigation and adaptation activities, assessing the impacts (greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas) of mitigation and adaptation activities, as well as tracking climate finance (both national and international) flows. The State of Palestine aims to integrate the necessary MRV activities into existing processes and structures for international reporting to ensure an efficient and consistent approach. Palestine is in the process of determining the most appropriate process for MRV of NDC implementation and is intending to implement a robust MRV system. </p><p>The Palestinian Government has chosen the Environment Quality Authority to be the single national entity responsible for driving the implementation of the NDC, and reporting on progress on NDC implementation. The State of Palestine has a National Committee on Climate Change, which is a cross-ministerial expert advisory committee. Its aim is to support the Palestinian Government in the implementation and evaluation of its climate policies. It advises on where attention is required with regard to risks and on mitigation and adaptation needs. The National Committee on Climate Change, on behalf of the Palestinian Government, is responsible for preparing climate-related policies, and following decisions by the Cabinet, and monitoring implementation of these policies. The Environment Quality Authority will be given the responsibility to coordinate NDC implementation at the national level and between sectors.""</p>"

The State of Palestine's NDC is also ambitious in light of the country's challenging political circumstances. The Israeli occupation obstructs the State of Palestine's ability to implement adaptation and mitigation activities. It is difficult for the State of Palestine to have full control over its emissions profile, as it is almost entirely dependent on imported energy from Israel due to political and logistical factors. In addition, the occupation prevents the State of Palestine having control of its own borders in the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, which impacts on Palestine's resilience to climate change. The occupation has also made information sharing and networking at a national level very difficult, impacting on the Palestinian Government's ability to address climate change challenges. The flow of information, cooperation and coordination between staff members that work on climate change in both the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip is hindered by road blocks, check points and the inability to move freely between both areas. </p><p>The NDC is also ambitious given that the State of Palestine has only been a party to the UNFCCC since March 2016. Despite being the newest State Party to the UNFCCC, in less than 9 months the State of Palestine has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, developed and published its INCR and NAP, and submitted its NDC to the UNFCCC.</p>"

In 2011, there were 0.8tCO2eq per capita per year, forecasted to grow to 1.6 tCO2eq per capita per year in 2040 under the independence scenario or 1.2 tCO2eq per capita per year under the status quo scenario. This is significantly less than the global average of 7.58 tCO2eq per capita per year. Moreover, the State of Palestine's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was approximately US$ 2,800 in 2011 and is forecast to be US$ 9,400in 2040 under the independence scenario or US$ 7,400 in 2040 under the status quo scenario. This is also significantly less than the global average of US$ 10,400 GDP/capita in 2011. However, despite the State of Palestine's small share of global greenhouse gas emissions and low level of economic development, the Palestinian Government is committed to making a fair and ambitious contribution to global efforts to limit emissions consistent with the objectives of the UNFCCC.
