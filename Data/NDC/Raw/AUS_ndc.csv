The 25 per cent target is conditional on the inclusion of forests (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries) and the land sector in the global agreement, while the 15 per cent target is conditional on progress for their inclusion <br /> In its BR1, Australia reported that it would use the activity-based approach for including emissions and removals from LULUCF in its target. The Party also reported that, in 2013, it announced its decision to further broaden the coverage of the land sector to include net emissions from cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation activities within its second commitment period target under the Kyoto Protocol. <br />"

Australia assumes that all available units from international market mechanisms, including the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, will contribute to meeting its 2020 targets. The use of these units in Australia's Carbon Pricing Mechanism will be governed by domestic legislation and regulations. Under this legislation from 2015, certain credits from the CDM may be used to meet obligations under the Carbon Pricing Mechanism, and these credits would be counted towards Australia's targets. <br />"
