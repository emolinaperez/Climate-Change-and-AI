Another issue that proves country’s NDC2 ambitions refers to the application of an economy-wide absolute emission reduction target (in compliance with Article 4.4 of Paris Agreement), which ensures reaching the objectives in a relevant, complete, consistent, transparent, and accurate manner."

This support will allow adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of Moldova towards a low-carbon economy, thus moving towards progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of Real GDP per capita, equal to 4,483 US$/capita in 2030, which will still be approximately one-tenth of EU 28 average, forecasted to be US$ 43,516/capita in 2030.
