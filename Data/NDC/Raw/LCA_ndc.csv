In doing so, Saint Lucia was able to take advantage of updated inventories, robust data and cross-cutting expertise.</li><li>Capitalising on the synergies and timing of the different processes, Saint Lucia increased collaboration across Implementing Partners and reduced the need to conduct separate stakeholder consultations on similar issues, therefore reducing stakeholder fatigue. It is essential for Implementing Partners to work together in a seamless manner.</li><li>In determining the level of ambition, it was crucial for Saint Lucia to undertake long-term energy system modeling for 2050 and what would subsequently be recommended at 2030 to support energy transformation, decarbonisation and building resilience.</li><li>The engagement of stakeholders from public sector, private sector, academia and civil society was key to ensuring the interest and buy-in to the NDC process and revised targets. Specific engagement was undertaken with the youth, who account for a large percentage of the population.</li><li>Please see Section 4(a)(i) for the Cabinet-approved guidance on the engagement of stakeholders and the development of climate-relevant instruments.</li></ul>"
