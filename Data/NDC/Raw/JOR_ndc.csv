The Country&rsquo;s bulk share of GHGs represents only around 0.06% of global total according to a global GHGs analysis conducted in 2010. According to the World Bank, the CO<sub>2</sub> metric tons per capita emission is 3.4 in 2010 as said before. Nevertheless, this small share of GHG did not justify a reluctant reaction of the Country. To the contrary, Jordan, historically, was amongst the most active countries in the region with regard to involvement in international climate change efforts and engagement in response actions as explained above. Most importantly, Jordan has voluntarily developed a national climate change policy in 2013, the first comprehensive policy in the Arab Region and the Middle East. In fact, Jordan willingly developed the National Climate Change Policy for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 2013-2020. This policy is considered the first national-level comprehensive planning initiative to deal with the global phenomenon of climate change in a holistic approach in the Country. However, Jordan, as any of non-Annex I countries, has, so far, no commitments for GHG emission reduction targets. Nevertheless, Jordan believes that there is a large potential for mitigation, even though Jordan&rsquo;s total GHG emissions are very small in absolute terms, and compared to other countries as indicated above.</p><p>From another angle, the modest income levels of the Country along with development challenges described above, mainly poverty and unemployment as two of the most important challenges the Country faces as well as limitation in natural resources and energy challenges along with the demographic characteristics of the Jordanian population all show that the Jordanian development process faces a big challenge in providing basic needs in such a developing country. Moreover, the rapid growths in economic activities, population and successive influxes of refugees over the last decade have imposed additional demands on energy resources. While Jordan has achieved many sustainable development goals, sustaining these results and reducing the burden of the energy sector on economic and social development will increasingly depend on the transition to a sustainable energy future. The high cost of importing energy puts a heavy burden on the public budget already constrained by running costs. There is no doubt that given the current financial pressures on our economy and its people and the elevated and continuing level of insecurity and conflict in our region, the INDC of Jordan specially those presented in the Vision 2025 are all fair and ambitious.""</p>"
23226864,"CAIT","JOR","Jordan","Overview","Fairness and Ambition",NA,NA,"fairness","Description of fairness","<p>Jordan communicated the following information describing how its INDC is fair and ambitious.</p><p>""Taking into consideration that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be differentiated according to a Party&rsquo;s responsibility and capability, Jordan believes that its very diversified INDC (a combination of a wide rainbow of outcomes and actions) set together an ambitious target relevance to its small amount of GHGs emission share and development circumstances. The Country&rsquo;s bulk share of GHGs represents only around 0.06% of global total according to a global GHGs analysis conducted in 2010. According to the World Bank, the CO<sub>2</sub> metric tons per capita emission is 3.4 in 2010 as said before. Nevertheless, this small share of GHG did not justify a reluctant reaction of the Country. To the contrary, Jordan, historically, was amongst the most active countries in the region with regard to involvement in international climate change efforts and engagement in response actions as explained above. Most importantly, Jordan has voluntarily developed a national climate change policy in 2013, the first comprehensive policy in the Arab Region and the Middle East. In fact, Jordan willingly developed the National Climate Change Policy for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 2013-2020. This policy is considered the first national-level comprehensive planning initiative to deal with the global phenomenon of climate change in a holistic approach in the Country. However, Jordan, as any of non-Annex I countries, has, so far, no commitments for GHG emission reduction targets. Nevertheless, Jordan believes that there is a large potential for mitigation, even though Jordan&rsquo;s total GHG emissions are very small in absolute terms, and compared to other countries as indicated above.</p><p>From another angle, the modest income levels of the Country along with development challenges described above, mainly poverty and unemployment as two of the most important challenges the Country faces as well as limitation in natural resources and energy challenges along with the demographic characteristics of the Jordanian population all show that the Jordanian development process faces a big challenge in providing basic needs in such a developing country. Moreover, the rapid growths in economic activities, population and successive influxes of refugees over the last decade have imposed additional demands on energy resources. While Jordan has achieved many sustainable development goals, sustaining these results and reducing the burden of the energy sector on economic and social development will increasingly depend on the transition to a sustainable energy future. The high cost of importing energy puts a heavy burden on the public budget already constrained by running costs. There is no doubt that given the current financial pressures on our economy and its people and the elevated and continuing level of insecurity and conflict in our region, the INDC of Jordan specially those presented in the Vision 2025 are all fair and ambitious.""</p>"
