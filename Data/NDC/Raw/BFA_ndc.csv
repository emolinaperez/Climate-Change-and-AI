And the Integrated Adaptation Scenario lends itself well to transforming the resource consumption economy of Burkina Faso into a gradually green (or almost green) economy and into a society with low carbon emissions. In this scenario, it is estimated that the total value of the environmental services provided by the actions that are proposed in the AFOLU sectors over the 15 years up to 2030 would be at least US $11,500,000,000, which would give a return on investment of more than 400% (which, when compared with the solely financial return of primary production of 64%, is six times greater).

It takes into account and operationalizes all policies and strategies linked to rural development. It was communicated that the mitigation potential of the programme is estimated to be 9.1 Mt CO2 eq, or 1.2 Mt CO2 eq/year between 2008 and 2015.<br /> <br /> It was mentioned that the actions to be implemented under the programme are expected to contribute to the Government's objectives of: restoring 30,000 ha/year degraded forests; increasing plantations from 68,000 to 100,000 ha/year; increasing the area of natural forests from 170,000 to 500,000 ha; reducing the area of forests burned by wildfires from 30 to 20 per cent; and training local villagers on the sustainable management of natural resources.<br /> <br /> The programme consists of three main actions, the first of which relates to reforestation and forest management and has a time frame for implementation of five years. The first project involves: <br /> <br /> (a) Mapping the potential for creating forest/reforestation/managing existing forests;<br /> <br /> (b) Raising the awareness of the main stakeholders and building their technical capacity for creating forest/reforestation/managing forests;<br /> <br /> (c) Providing institutional support for creating forest/reforestation/managing forests and disseminating information;<br /> <br /> (d) Building the capacity of local villagers for income-generating activities linked to the sustainable management of forests;<br /> <br /> (e) Developing and testing scenarios for the registration of community forests;<br /> <br /> (f) Promoting techniques for improving carbon sequestration by forests;<br /> <br /> (g) Developing and promoting partnerships between community forests within and outside of the country;<br /> <br /> (h) Strengthening the capacity of local villagers and municipal councils for the establishment of communal forests;<br /> <br /> (i) Monitoring and evaluation, learning lessons and the dissemination of experiences.<br /> <br /> A second project relates to animal waste, with a time frame for implementation of five years. It includes: actions relating to feasibility and market studies; setting up regional directorates; marketing and raising public awareness; identifying partners for implementation; building biodigesters; and research into, and the development and standardization of, equipment.<br /> <br /> The third project relates to urban waste and wastewater, with a time frame for implementation of five years. It involves: the analysis and detailed mapping of soils; building biodigesters; setting up a system for the transportation of biogas; and identifying subcontractors, among other things.<br /> <br /> The Ministry of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources will be the focal point for the action and the National Office for Water and Sanitation will be responsible for its implementation.<br /> <br /> The second proposal communicated by Burkina Faso relates to the National White Book to facilitate access to energy. It was developed to achieve the objectives for 2015 of facilitating access to modern energy forms to reduce poverty and of reaching the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.<br /> <br /> The mitigation potential of the second proposal is estimated to be 3.3 Mt CO2 eq, or 0.4 Mt CO2 eq/year for the period 2008-2015.<br /> <br /> The initiative is expected to contribute to the Government's targets of: providing 75 per cent of the population with access to modern cooking facilities by 2015; providing 52 per cent of the rural population with access to employment opportunities; and providing 66 per cent of the total population with access to electricity by 2015.<br /> <br /> In addition, the proposal will deliver co-benefits, including an increase in the production of agroproducts for bigger markets; the modernization of social services (health, education, water, etc.); an improvement in living conditions, particularly of women; the sustainable use of natural resources; increased carbon storage/sinks; and improved income-generating opportunities in rural areas. The proposal, with a time frame for implementation of five years, identifies three main actions:<br /> <br /> (a) The rational use of energy, which would involve, inter alia: an energy diagnostic; the identification of energy-saving measures; establishing energy managers in relevant ministries; the identification of companies for the implementation of recommendations from energy audits; awareness-raising tools targeting households and services; monitoring and evaluation; and the dissemination of best practices;<br /> <br /> (b) The use of solar energy for rural electrification, which would involve: the identification of potentially suitable areas; feasibility studies; the development of project proposals and tenders; setting up electricity cooperatives; monitoring and evaluation; and the dissemination of lessons learned;<br /> <br /> (c) The rational use of firewood for cooking, which would involve, inter alia: the development of prototypes of improved wood stoves; the identification of non-governmental organizations, associations and craftsmen to implement the project; developing awareness and marketing tools for households; monitoring and evaluation; and the dissemination of lessons learned.<br /> <br /> Burkina Faso communicated that, with regard to support needs, it requires capacity-building support for: conducting monitoring and evaluation; estimating GHG emission abatement; using software for monitoring operational variables; and setting up a national MRV system."
