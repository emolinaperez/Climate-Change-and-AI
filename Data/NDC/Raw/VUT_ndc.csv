The purpose of that particular process was to strengthen the existing content on adaptation in the NDC by developing quantifiable targets for adaptation that will be communicated to the UNFCCC. The objectives were to do so through developing national quantifiable climate change adaptation targets and indicators for the in two priority sectors: agriculture and water. Further to this, this process aimed to determine how to incorporate climate change loss and damage (L&D) considerations into the development of water and agriculture sector targets and indicators."""
