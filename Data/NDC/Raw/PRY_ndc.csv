Y en donde el mismo art&iacute;culo indica que al llevar a la pr&aacute;ctica los compromisos hay que atender las necesidades y preocupaciones espec&iacute;ficas de las partes que son pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo derivadas de los efectos adversos del cambio clim&aacute;tico o del impacto de la aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas de respuesta, en especial de algunos pa&iacute;ses &ldquo;entre los cuales citan a los pa&iacute;ses sin litoral&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br /><br />Por tanto en las siguientes paginas est&aacute;n descritas las contribuciones nacionales del Paraguay con lo cual nuestro pa&iacute;s se fija metas ambiciosas y justas a fin de evitar emisiones por un valor de 429 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. durante el periodo de implementaci&oacute;n de este plan de acci&oacute;n, y a partir del 2030 evitar emisiones por un total de 83 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. en forma anual, establecidos de acuerdo a los c&aacute;lculos de desarrollo proyectados en los estudios existentes.&rdquo;<br /><br />Paraguay is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Adaptation to these changes in climate is a must in order to lessen their damage. The lacking information and strategies on how to cope with the impacts of climate change cause environmental, social, health and economic problems; therefore it is necessary to focus the action plans towards adaptation, in which the participation of all possible actors is included.<br /><br />Based on common but differentiated responsibilities of each country, as mentioned in article four of the commitments of the UNFCCC, national and regional development priorities are in accordance with national circumstances. The same article states that it is necessary to implement the commitments of developing country parties to meet their specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse effects of climate change or the impact of the implementation of response measures, especially in some countries ""including landlocked countries"".</p> <p>Therefore in the following pages Paraguay describes its ambitious and fair national contribution which would avoid emissions of 429 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq during the implementation of this action plan, and avoid emissions from 2030 onward of 83 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. annually, based on the calculations of current studies about development projections.&nbsp;</p>"

La adaptaci&oacute;n es un elemento imprescindible para ajustarnos ante estos cambios del clima con el fin de moderar el da&ntilde;o. La escasa informaci&oacute;n y falta de estrategias sobre c&oacute;mo hacer frente a los impactos del cambio clim&aacute;tico provocan problemas ambientales, sociales, de salud y econ&oacute;micos; por lo que es necesario encaminar los planes de acci&oacute;n hacia la adaptaci&oacute;n, en los cuales se incluya la participaci&oacute;n de todos los actores posibles.&nbsp;<br /><br />Basados en las responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas de cada uno de los pa&iacute;ses como lo menciona el art&iacute;culo cuarto de los compromisos de la CMNUCC, donde las prioridades nacionales y regionales de desarrollo, est&aacute;n enfocados de acuerdo a sus circunstancias nacionales. Y en donde el mismo art&iacute;culo indica que al llevar a la pr&aacute;ctica los compromisos hay que atender las necesidades y preocupaciones espec&iacute;ficas de las partes que son pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo derivadas de los efectos adversos del cambio clim&aacute;tico o del impacto de la aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas de respuesta, en especial de algunos pa&iacute;ses &ldquo;entre los cuales citan a los pa&iacute;ses sin litoral&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br /><br />Por tanto en las siguientes paginas est&aacute;n descritas las contribuciones nacionales del Paraguay con lo cual nuestro pa&iacute;s se fija metas ambiciosas y justas a fin de evitar emisiones por un valor de 429 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. durante el periodo de implementaci&oacute;n de este plan de acci&oacute;n, y a partir del 2030 evitar emisiones por un total de 83 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. en forma anual, establecidos de acuerdo a los c&aacute;lculos de desarrollo proyectados en los estudios existentes.&rdquo;<br /><br />Paraguay is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Adaptation to these changes in climate is a must in order to lessen their damage. The lacking information and strategies on how to cope with the impacts of climate change cause environmental, social, health and economic problems; therefore it is necessary to focus the action plans towards adaptation, in which the participation of all possible actors is included.<br /><br />Based on common but differentiated responsibilities of each country, as mentioned in article four of the commitments of the UNFCCC, national and regional development priorities are in accordance with national circumstances. The same article states that it is necessary to implement the commitments of developing country parties to meet their specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse effects of climate change or the impact of the implementation of response measures, especially in some countries ""including landlocked countries"".</p> <p>Therefore in the following pages Paraguay describes its ambitious and fair national contribution which would avoid emissions of 429 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq during the implementation of this action plan, and avoid emissions from 2030 onward of 83 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. annually, based on the calculations of current studies about development projections.&nbsp;</p>"
