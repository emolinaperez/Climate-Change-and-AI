23276247,"Pledges","SWZ","Eswatini","Overview","Overview of Commitment",NA,NA,"pledge_content","Pledge content","Swaziland communicated a NAMA in the agriculture sector and stated that, as agriculture accounts for significant levels of emissions in Swaziland, the NAMA has been prepared with a view to reducing GHG emissions, taking into account the national circumstances of the country and the overriding need to ensure food and nutrition security and sustainable livelihoods. The time frame for the implementation of the NAMA is expected to be from 2014 to 2020.<br /> Firstly, Swaziland communicated the following elements of its agricultural NAMA: <br /> <br /> (a) Changes in agricultural systems, including agroforestry and afforestation; protected cultivation; mixed farming; integrated farming; precision agriculture; organic farming; and conservation agriculture; <br /> <br /> (b) Changes in agricultural practices, including changing planting dates; introducing adaptable varieties/breeds and diversification; adopting sustainable land management techniques and approaches; supplementary livestock feeds; integrated pest management; production of healthy seeds and planting material; post-harvest handling and storage; soil health and fertility management; and correct plant populations and crop rotations;<br /> <br /> (c) Changes in agricultural water management, including water harvesting; reuse and recycling; on-farm irrigation, where appropriate; soil and water conservation; watershed management; agricultural diversification; promoting improved crop varieties, livestock breeds and fish fingerlings; increasing the value of sustainable agricultural practices through the valuation of carbon; and broadening the agricultural production base, through, for example, promoting small livestock and horticulture;<br /> <br /> (d) Risk management and insurance, including livestock and crop insurance and weather-based index insurance;<br /> <br /> (e) Agricultural research and technology development, including on participatory crop and livestock breeding; pest-, disease- and drought- and/or heat-tolerant crops; fish fingerlings; research into new farming systems; research into crop, livestock, soil, water and pest/disease/weed control issues; research as applied to area-specific varieties and practices;<br /> <br /> (f) Agricultural advisory service and information systems, including strong extension services; a participatory extension approach (including farmer-to-farmer training and farmer field schools); dissemination of climate-resilient varieties, technologies and practices; dissemination of seasonal climate forecasts; market and climate information systems; and ICT; <br /> <br /> (g) Agricultural market development, including cooperatives and groups for farm inputs and outputs; cooperative storage at farm level; infrastructure and market development; support for market information systems, including the use of ICT; and promoting agroprocessing and value-addition and post-harvest technologies; <br /> <br /> (h) Social protection and disaster risk management, including strengthening local and farmers' institutions and organizations; promoting microfinance schemes, including ensuring functioning financial markets and institutions; increasing the focus on risk sharing and risk reduction across the entire value chain; developing/enhancing climate information systems and early warning mechanisms; and developing/enhancing disaster risk management.<br /> Secondly, information was communicated on NAMAs in the following areas of governance: <br /> <br /> (a) Reviewing existing detrimental policies and regulations that worsen climate change impacts;<br /> <br /> (b) Mainstreaming win-win adaptation and mitigation strategies and actions through appropriate incentives, including through existing national and regional frameworks (at whatever stage of implementation) and regional agricultural development plans;<br /> <br /> (c) Developing policies to ameliorate the adverse impacts of livestock production and rearing;<br /> <br /> (d) Investigating financial risk management;<br /> <br /> (e) Strengthening existing agricultural institutions and developing new ones;<br /> <br /> (f) Investing in the good governance of farmer organizations.<br /> Thirdly, information was communicated on NAMAs relating to early readiness actions for scaling up best practices with the following elements:<br /> <br /> (a) National/sectoral strategy and action plans that enhance agricultural adaptation and the potential for mitigation;<br /> <br /> (b) Increased adaptation of crops, livestock and aquacultured organisms to climate stress;<br /> <br /> (c) Enhanced access to and utilization of technologies that enhance efficiency and productivity;<br /> <br /> (d) Increased use of a menu of resource-conserving technologies in agronomic practices, nutrient management, water management conservation, agriculture and crop residue management, agroforestry, restoration and rehabilitation, livestock management, fisheries and aquaculture, and efficient energy management;<br /> <br /> (e) Access to credit and microfinance;<br /> <br /> (f) Improved risk sharing, including crop and livestock insurance and weather-based index insurance;<br /> <br /> (g) Agricultural advisory services and information systems, including the use of mobile telephones.<br /> Regarding implementation and impact assessment, the Party communicated the following actions, including to: establish a specialized national institution responsible for MRV; develop a national MRV system; develop methodologies for the quantification of emissions, harmonization, quality assurance and standardization; and develop tools to monitor the impacts of adaptation interventions.<br /> Swaziland mentioned that the total budget of the NAMA is USD 4.4 million and that support from the international community is needed. In addition, the country will require support for the identification of the technological needs of the country and the relevant research and development, review and implementation. Finally, capacity-building will be required for: developing, implementing and monitoring the agricultural NAMA; the provision and use of tools to enable accurate and full GHG emission accounting; the optimum use by farmers, farmer organizations and other agricultural stakeholders of available resources and technologies; and agricultural extension, research and development in the country.<br />"
