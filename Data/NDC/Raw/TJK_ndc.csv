Since 1991, at the initial stage of the period of state independence, and especially during the period 1992-2000, the Republic of Tajikistan had experienced grave consequences resulting from civil war and of the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, with a sharp increase in poverty. During the period 2008-2015, the socio-economic indicators of the Republic of Tajikistan have improved. For the Republic of Tajikistan, the basic priority of climate measures lies in adaptation because of high dependence of the considerable part of the population and of the branches of the economy on climatic conditions, also taking into account the key role of the country's mountain ecosystems in water resources generation and biological diversity for Central Asia. The existing assessed contribution of the Republic of Tajikistan to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 0.02%. In view of a low level of greenhouse gas emissions and a very high share of hydro-power (more than 90%), the level of greenhouse gas emissions of the Republic of Tajikistan will amount to 80-90% by 2030, as compared to 1990 (as stated in the INDC); this will ensure the achievement of socially acceptable and scientifically grounded indicators, both in absolute and per capita terms. By doing so, the Republic of Tajikistan adheres to the basic principle of the UNFCCC &ndash; common but differentiated responsibility &ndash; and expects an adequate level of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from economically developed countries and the largest countries-emitters of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC scientific recommendations to prevent global warming of more than 2 degrees Сelsius. The international support of the intentions of the Republic of Tajikistan with respect to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and a full-scale implementation of climate adaptation and resilience measures will enable the country to be strongly on track to green economy and climate-resilient development. The forests and gardens in Tajikistan are of critical importance for the preservation of mountain ecosystems and biodiversity, improvement of the state of lands and prevention of their further degradation, protection of vulnerable infrastructure, protection of water resources and carbon absorption from the atmosphere. That is why they play a specific role both in terms of mitigating the impact of anthropogenic activity on the climate and reducing negative consequences.""</p>"
