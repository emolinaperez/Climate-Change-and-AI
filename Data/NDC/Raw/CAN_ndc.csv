23226158,"CAIT","CAN","Canada","Overview","Fairness and Ambition",NA,NA,"ambition","Description of ambition","<p>The information on fairness and ambition was communicated in a combined section in the INDC and was separated based on the content.</p><p>""This target is ambitious but achievable. It represents a substantial reduction from Canada&rsquo;s business-as-usual emissions. Canada has already undertaken decisive actions domestically to reduce our emissions, and is committed to doing more in concert with all major emitters. Reaching this ambitious target will require new policies in additional sectors and coordinated continental action in integrated sectors. Canada may also use international mechanisms to achieve the target, subject to robust systems that deliver real and verified emissions reductions.</p> <p>Canada is making progress in reducing our emissions &ndash; from 2005 to 2013, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 3.1% while the economy grew by 12.9%. The Government of Canada is implementing a responsible sector-by-sector regulatory approach to reduce emissions, aligned with Canada&rsquo;s major economic partners, like the United States, recognizing the importance of cooperative action in an integrated North American marketplace. Through this approach Canada has already taken steps to reduce emissions from two of the largest emitting sectors of the Canadian economy &ndash; transportation and electricity.</p><p>Building on the strong base of clean electricity generation, Canada has established stringent coal-fired electricity standards that ban the construction of traditional coal-fired electricity generation units, and will accelerate the phase-out of existing coal-fired electricity generation units. Canada has also taken action in the transportation sector, which is responsible for approximately 25% of Canada&rsquo;s emissions, by working closely with the United States towards common North American greenhouse gas standards for vehicles. The Government of Canada has put in place progressively more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks as well as regulations for heavy-duty vehicles. As a result of these regulations, greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicles, light trucks and heavy-duty vehicles are steadily declining. For example, 2025 model year passenger vehicles and light trucks will emit about half as many greenhouse gases as 2008 models.</p> <p>Canada is continuing to develop and implement measures to reduce emissions from other key greenhouse gas sources. For example, in December 2014 the Government of Canada announced our intent to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the fastest growing greenhouse gases globally. Canada intends to develop regulations to address methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas fired electricity, chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers through our responsible sector-by-sector regulatory approach that ensures Canada&rsquo;s economic competitiveness is protected. Canada will continue to take cooperative action with our continental trading partners, particularly the United States, and will work towards further action in integrated sectors of the economy, including energy and transportation.</p><p>Canada&rsquo;s regulatory approach is coupled with significant investments in clean energy technologies in order to drive a steady transition to a low carbon economy. Since 2006, the Government of Canada has invested more than $10 billion in green infrastructure, energy efficiency, clean energy technologies, cleaner fuels and smarter grids. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Investments towards the development and demonstration of clean technology products such as electrical vehicle charging stations and wind hybrid power plants.</li> <li>Investments to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, low-impact hydro, biomass, photovoltaic and geothermal energy.</li> </ul> <p>Canada is a leader in clean energy technologies, and has made multiple investments in such technologies to promote further innovation. Examples include the world&rsquo;s first large scale power sector carbon capture and storage project in Saskatchewan, as well as the first carbon capture and storage project at an oil sands operation. As a result, Canada is making meaningful progress to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in key sectors. For example, emerging technologies and federal regulatory action has limited emissions in the transportation sector, despite growth in vehicle fleets while emissions are falling in the electricity sector due to coal phase out, switching to natural gas and growth in non-emitting generation. To build on this success, Canada will focus climate-related investments in innovative production technologies to continue to drive further improvements in environmental performance in the oil sands and other growing sectors.</p> <p>In Canada, climate change is a shared responsibility that requires action from all levels of government. Canadian provinces and territories have jurisdictional authorities over the fields of natural resources, energy, and many aspects of the environment. Each has its own legal framework, policies and measures in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, a federal/provincial/territorial intergovernmental forum, has agreed that climate change will be on its agenda on an ongoing basis.""</p>"
