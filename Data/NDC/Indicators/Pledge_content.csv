"Overview","Pledge content","<p><u>Energy supply: increasing renewable options</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>PV and solar heating</i></p> <p>Mongolia is located in a region with abundant sunshine, and typically receives between 2,250 and 3,300 hours/year. PV systems have been shown to be the less expensive option compared with small gasoline generators. At present, small-scale PV systems (10-1,000 W) are used in remote areas. It has been assessed that PV power systems are competitive with conventional energy sources for small-power applications for nomadic families and communities in Mongolia.</p> <p>The installation of large-scale PV systems in the Gobi region of Mongolia may contribute both to protecting against air pollution and to supporting regional development. It will be necessary to implement pilot research projects in the areas situated along the railway network and to consider PV systems in the Mongolian Gobi desert and steppe areas in the future.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Wind power generators and wind farms</i></p> <p>As in the case of solar energy, there is potential to supply nomadic herders and farmers in rural areas with small, portable wind generation systems. Renewable energy development is included in the Government Action Programme and will serve as the principal way to provide electricity to remote areas and nomadic families. Turbine generators (with a total capacity of 100-150 kW) could be placed in provincial centres in the southern part of Mongolia. The most promising sites should be prioritized according to the technical and economic feasibility of operating wind turbine generators with a total capacity of 100-150 kW in parallel with existing diesel generators.</p> <p>In addition, large-scale wind farm projects could be implemented in Mongolia. The Party already has the experience of establishing a wind farm with a total capacity of 50 MW in Mongolia.</p> <p><i>Hydropower plants</i></p> <p>Hydropower development is one of the best options for electricity supply in remote areas and for consumers with limited demands. A number of promising hydropower sites have been identified in Mongolia. Currently, the Taishir (11 MW) and Durgun (12 MW) hydropower plants are in operation, and more than 20 hydropower sites have been identified, with capacities ranging from 5 MW to 110 MW. The development of these plants is moderately feasible in Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia encourages the use of small- and medium-sized hydroelectric developments. The emissions reduction potential of this option is high, and its local benefits are expected to outweigh the negative impacts.</p> <p>The Taishir and Durgun hydropower plants were registered as CDM projects with CERs of 29,600 and 30,000 t CO2/year, respectively. The 220 MW Egiin gol Hydroelectric Power Generation Project, with potential CERs of 192,500 t/year, is in the project development stage.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving coal quality</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Coal beneficiation</i></p> <p>Mongolia has substantial coal reserves. Coal will continue in the future to be the most economic fuel for power and heat generation in the central energy system and for heat generation in provincial centres. Currently, no provision exists for coal preparation at mining sites and, as a result, there is no quality control in the supply system. Coal quality often does not meet the minimum standard requirements, and in many cases emergency situations at the power stations are caused by the low quality of the coal.</p> <p>Coal washing can be introduced at the biggest coal mines in Mongolia, such as Baganuur, Shivee-Ovoo and Tavantolgoi. This option is technically feasible; there are low institutional barriers. This option is already included in the Mongolian Environmental Action Plan.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Coal briquetting</i></p> <p>Coal is one of the most significant sources of environmental pollution, especially air pollution. Therefore, to introduce the coal briquetting technology may well be an efficient way to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce air pollution. Some studies and investigations on conventional formed coal briquettes have been carried out by several Mongolian organizations. However, the quality of the coal briquettes does not meet the required standards.</p> <p>A feasibility study on the production of conventional coal briquettes carried out by the Mining Institute of Mongolia with the support of the United Nations Development Programme shows that the production cost was estimated at 14,000 togrogs/t (i.e. USD 13.5/t).</p> <p>According to estimates by the Hashimoto Sangyo Company of Japan in Mongolia, the initial capital cost for a small-scale (5,000-6,000 t/year) coal briquetting plant amounts to approximately USD 9.6 million. Compared with other technologies (e.g. liquefaction and gasification) for the production of clean fuel from coal, the coal briquetting technology has several advantages, such as lower investment and lower life cycle costs.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving the efficiency of heating boilers&nbsp;</u><br /> <br /> <i>Improve the efficiency of existing heating boilers and install new, highly energy-efficient ones</i></p> <p>One of the features of the Mongolian climate is the long winter season with extremely cold temperatures, which typically drop to between -30 C and -40 C. Heating is therefore an essential requirement for sustaining life. Typically, small heating boilers in provincial centres use between 800 and 1,200 t of coal/year on average in order to produce 0.8-1.2 MW of power and heating.</p> <p>These boilers provide heating for schools, hospitals, kindergartens and other public institutions with very low efficiency (0.4-0.5 MW) due to outdated equipment. The use of 12 efficient boilers with a capacity of 25 MW would produce a CO2 emissions reduction of 91,000 t/year. The installation of 260 new boilers with a capacity of 1 MW would reduce CO2 emissions by 340,000 t/year.<br /> <br /> <i>Convert hot water boilers into small-capacity thermal power plants</i></p> <p>This option would convert hot water boilers into thermal power plants with a capacity of 5-10 MW. This would provide the heating and power supply for provincial centres and nearby provincial areas. Converting steam boilers into small-capacity thermal power plants (5 - 10 MW) would reduce CO2 emissions by 190,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving household stoves and furnaces</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Change the fuels used for household stoves and furnaces</i></p> <p>Household stoves in cities have poor energy efficiency, pollute the environment and threaten human health due to insufficient fuel burning. One of the potential options to reduce environmental pollution and GHG emissions is to exchange the raw coal used in stoves with LPG and coal briquettes.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Modernize the existing design and implement the new design for household stoves and furnaces</i></p> <p>The modernization of 250,000 household stoves and furnaces would reduce CO2 emissions by 920,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: improving combined heat and power (CHP) plants</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Improve efficiency and reduce internal use</i></p> <p>At present, six CHP plants are operating in Mongolia with a total installed electrical capacity of 824 MW, a steam production capacity of 7,100 t/h and an annual load factor of 71.4 per cent. The plants' own use for electricity is 22.3 per cent, and for heat production is around 15 per cent. Total CO2 emissions from the CHP sector amounted to 6,372 Gg. Therefore, the CHP plants are one of the main contributors to total national GHG emissions. In particular, energy efficiency improvements, including the reduction of own use, should be seriously considered for GHG mitigation.</p> <p>The implementation of these actions would produce CO2 reductions of 185,000 t/year.<br /> <br /> <u>Energy supply: increasing the use of electricity for local heating in cities</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Use of electricity from the grid for individual households in cities</i></p> <p>The main purpose of this option is to reduce air pollution and GHG emissions in Ulaanbaatar city. The Government of Mongolia is aware of the need to reduce air pollution in Ulaanbaatar and is investigating many alternative options, including the use of electricity for heating in ""ger"" (traditional tent houses) districts. However, no detailed research has yet been undertaken and no projects have yet been implemented.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the construction sector: energy efficiency improvements in buildings</u>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Improve the district heating system in buildings</i></p> <p>Energy loss is high in the heat distribution systems of Mongolia. Urgent actions are required to reduce this loss by minimizing leaks and replacing valves and compensators. In addition, residential consumers need to save energy by regulating room temperature.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Install heat and hot water meters in apartments</i></p> <p>In Mongolia, about 30 per cent of the population lives in apartment complexes which are connected to the central heat supply network. Many apartments do not have heat meters and their heating fee and price is calculated based on a fixed tariff that does not reflect the actual amount of heat used.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Carry out insulation improvements to existing buildings and implement new energy-efficient standards for new buildings</i></p> <p>A national study on heat loss concluded that nearly 40 per cent of the heat supply for houses and buildings is lost. The heat loss occurs through windows, walls and doors. Current standards are lower by two to three times; this shows that most houses have a higher than average rate of heat loss.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Improve the lighting efficiency in buildings</i></p> <p>This demand-side management option concerns the use of energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps to replace inefficient incandescent light bulbs. The lighting demand of households and service sectors accounted for 380 GWh and is expected to increase in the future. Currently, most households and about 30 per cent of service and commercial buildings use incandescent light bulbs, while the rest use compact fluorescent lamps.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the industry sector: energy efficiency improvements in industry&nbsp;</u><br /> <br /> <i>Improve housekeeping practices</i></p> <p>Mongolian industries have great potential to save energy through energy-use management. The energy-saving potential in industries can be divided into ""easy"" savings (no- and low-cost), medium-cost savings and long-term possibilities. The energy-saving potential through ""easy"" savings (good housekeeping and energy management) is 15-25 per cent, with a pay-back period of less than one year.</p> <p>The implementation of this option could lead to a CO2 emissions reduction of about 300,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Implement motor efficiency improvements</i></p> <p>Mongolia relies heavily on motor systems to power the operations of the industrial sector. Motor systems consume about 70 per cent of industrial electricity in Mongolia. These motor systems are often less efficient than those in industrialized countries. Motor efficiency improvement technology includes: energy-efficient motors; variable speed drives; improved operation and maintenance; the correction of previous oversizing; improved mechanical power transmission; and the efficiency of driven equipment. It is estimated that the electricity-saving potential equates to 20 per cent of total electricity consumption by industrial motors.</p> <p>The implementation of this option could lead to a CO2 emissions reduction of about 240,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Introducing dry processing in the cement industry</i></p> <p>Changing the wet processing of cement to dry processing would save a large amount of energy. Feasibility studies show that 25 per cent of all industrial coal is used for cement production. The wet processing of cement requires 1,500 to 1,700 kcal/kg.cl of heating, whereas dry processing requires between 1,000 and 1,200 kcal/kg.cl. This shows that the energy-saving potential of coal consumption in the cement sector is about 40 per cent. The reduction in CO2 emissions from the implementation of this option would be about 147,000 t/year.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the transport sector</u>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Use of more fuel-efficient vehicles</i></p> <p>A total of 200,288 vehicles were registered in Mongolia in 2007, which represents a significant increase of 1.9 times the number of registered vehicles in 2000. This rapid growth in traffic and in the transport load has intensified the negative impacts on public health and environmental pollution. To promote the import of fuel-efficient vehicles, economic measures, such as the implementation of used vehicle import standards and a vehicle registration tax, could be implemented in order to improve the overall fuel efficiency of vehicles.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>In the agriculture sector</i></p> <p>Limit the increase in the total number of livestock by increasing the productivity of each type of animal, especially cattle.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <u>In the forestry sector</u><br /> <br /> <i>Improve forest management</i></p> <p>Mongolian forests provide a multitude of services with regard to climate change and other environmental problems, including serving as carbon sinks, sources of renewable energy, watershed protection and soil erosion protection. Many of these services have been lost, or will be lost, due to the extreme pressure exerted on Mongolia's forest resources.</p> <p>The following major mitigation options have been identified for the forestry sector:&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (a) Natural regeneration;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (b) Forestry plantation;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (c) Agroforestry;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (d) Shelter belts;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> (e) Bioelectricity.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <i>Reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, improve the sustainable management of forests and enhance forest carbon stocks in the Mongolian forestry sector</i></p> <p>There is some potential for GHG emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation in Mongolia. It would therefore be possible to initiate and implement a REDD project in Mongolia through reforestation activities by implementing community-based forest management improvements and the sustainable use of forest resources.</p>",1

"Overview","Pledge content","Armenia communicated the following NAMAs: <br /> <br /> (a) The implementation of the National Programme on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy of the Republic of Armenia (2007), which aims to: <br /> <br /> (i) Increase energy production from renewable sources;<br /> <br /> (ii) Modernize thermal power plants;<br /> <br /> (iii) Improve energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy;<br /> <br /> (iv) Improve energy efficiency in buildings and construction;<br /> <br /> (v) Decrease the loss of methane (CH4) during gas transportation and from gas delivery systems;<br /> <br /> (b) In the transport sector, expand the use of electrical transport and increase the share of natural gas in fuel used for motorized transport;<br /> <br /> (c) Decrease CH4 emissions from solid municipal waste and wastewater;<br /> <br /> (d) Restore degraded forests, reduce deforestation, sustain soil CO2 content and ensure its increase, and promote afforestation.<br /> <br /> Armenia stated that its communication is made under the explicit understanding that the preamble of the Copenhagen Accord contains a reference to decision 1/CP.15, on the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA), and decision 1/CMP.5, on the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP), which requests the continuance of the two-track negotiating process.",1
"Overview","Pledge content","As part of a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012 whereby major-emitting Parties agree on emission reductions in line with the objective of a maximum 2 C global temperature rise, Norway will move from its initial pledge of an emission reduction target of 30 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels to a target of a 40 per cent reduction for the same time frame.<br /> <br /> An important feature of Norwegian climate change policy is the flexible and costeffective Kyoto Protocol based approach. The continuation of the Kyoto Protocol or its basic elements as part of a future framework, in particular the availability of flexibility mechanisms for compliance with emission reduction commitments, is therefore an underlying premise for Norway's emission reduction target. Norway underlined the importance of pursuing various approaches, including opportunities to use markets, as stated in paragraph 7 of the Copenhagen Accord.",1

"Overview","Pledge content","Burkina Faso communicated proposals for a framework for the development of two NAMAs: one in the rural development sector and one in the energy sector.<br /> <br /> The first proposal relates to the National Rural Sector Programme, with a 2015 horizon. It takes into account and operationalizes all policies and strategies linked to rural development. It was communicated that the mitigation potential of the programme is estimated to be 9.1 Mt CO2 eq, or 1.2 Mt CO2 eq/year between 2008 and 2015.<br /> <br /> It was mentioned that the actions to be implemented under the programme are expected to contribute to the Government's objectives of: restoring 30,000 ha/year degraded forests; increasing plantations from 68,000 to 100,000 ha/year; increasing the area of natural forests from 170,000 to 500,000 ha; reducing the area of forests burned by wildfires from 30 to 20 per cent; and training local villagers on the sustainable management of natural resources.<br /> <br /> The programme consists of three main actions, the first of which relates to reforestation and forest management and has a time frame for implementation of five years.

"Overview","Pledge content","Colombia communicated that it is undertaking studies on its mitigation potential and on abatement cost curves for the transport, agriculture, energy, waste management and industrial sectors as part of its national strategy of low-carbon emissions development.<br /> The Party communicated the following preliminary mitigation actions in three categories: <br /> <br /> (a) Unilateral actions: Colombia will guarantee that at least 77 per cent of the total energy capacity installed by 2020 will be generated from renewable sources. These are actions that Colombia commits to undertake using its own resources, both private and public; the Party would not require any international or market-based funding;<br /> <br /> (b) Actions with financial support:<br /> <br /> (i) Colombia will reduce deforestation in the Colombian Amazon rainforest to zero by 2020;<br /> <br /> (ii) Colombia will stimulate the growth of biofuel production, such as ethanol and biodiesel, without endangering the natural forests or the food security of the Colombian people, and by promoting the use of these fuels in the national market with the aim of achieving a 20 per cent share of total national fuel consumption by 2020. These are actions that Colombia is interested in undertaking and willing to do, but it lacks the necessary resources or capacity, and will therefore require financial support for their implementation; <br /> <br /> (c) Actions related to carbon markets:<br /> <br /> (i) Colombia supports the use of market-based mechanisms in order to contribute to GHG mitigation actions in developing countries. Colombia has made use of the existing flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, especially the CDM, for which Colombia has a project portfolio with an estimated annual emissions reduction potential of 17.4 Mt CO2;<br /> <br /> (ii) Colombia has great potential to reduce emissions from deforestation (REDD) through the protection of endangered forests and the inclusion of new protected areas in the national parks programme;<br /> <br /> (iii) Colombia has estimated a total emissions reduction of up to 54.8 Mt CO2 by 2020 through the implementation of the CDM in the energy, forest, industrial, transport and waste management sectors. Up to now, eight projects in Colombia have been accredited with 763,371 certified emission reduction (CER) units from activities related to wind power generation, mass transport systems and hydroelectric power generation;<br /> <br /> (iv) Colombia will encourage commercial reforestation through the use of Forest Incentive Certificates;<br /> <br /> (v) Colombia has great mitigation potential that could be realized through the implementation of the existing flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the future mechanisms that may arise from negotiations, which would help the Party to achieve greater emission reductions by deviating from the 'business as usual' scenario.<br /> The implementation of these mitigation actions could be supported by carbon market-based mechanisms. These actions include: (a) the capacity to measure, report and verify emission reductions for their subsequent sale; (b) the availability of measuring and monitoring tools (similar to CDM mechanisms); (c) the possibility of achieving the financial closure of the projects or activity programmes with the incentive of selling the emission reductions.",1

This situation is primarily due to Israel's relatively high growth in population and the continuous increase in the standard of living. The results pointed to a 63 per cent increase in the country's GHG emissions by 2025, stemming largely from an increase in fuel combustion in the energy sector. As the energy sector is the major contributor to Israel's GHG emissions, the study focused mainly on expected developments in that sector.<br /> Israel also communicated information on its national circumstances, stating that the relatively low abatement potential in the country is due to: the low feasibility of many abatement measures, such as the absence of heavy industry; the low feasibility of biomass and carbon capture and storage; and land scarcity.<br /> Israel stated that the following main actions are budgeted for and expected to be implemented: <br /> <br /> (a) The development of a programme for the scrapping of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners in the household sector, replacing them with energy-efficient models;<br /> <br /> (b) The promotion of pilot projects for new and existing green buildings, including a building survey, and an experimental project for retrofitting insulation in existing buildings within the framework of the Government's urban renewal project;<br /> <br /> (c) Investment in education and information projects to increase awareness and promote behavioural changes among the public in order to achieve energy efficiency and GHG emission reductions; <br /> <br /> (d) Investment in the commercial integration of Israeli technologies aimed at reducing GHG emissions<br /> In addition, Israel provided information on a government-sponsored programme of subsidies to be provided to the industrial, commercial and municipal sectors for GHG emission reduction projects. The programme will provide a total subsidy of up to 10 million new sheqalim (USD 2.5 million) or up to 20 per cent of the total investment to eligible projects that deliver quantified reductions in GHG emissions until at least 2020.<br /> An inter-ministerial committee of all relevant ministries, headed by the Director General of the Finance Ministry, was set up to specify the steps required for the implementation of the national action plan.<br /> During 2013, procedures for tracking progress in the implementation of the national plan will be established. The monitoring results will be reported to the Government by the Minister of Environmental Protection at the end of each year.<br /> Finally, Israel will commission a new cost-benefit analysis to examine the potential for reducing GHG emissions after 2020. It will provide the basis for a long-term strategy for reducing emissions. Further, a national MRV system will be established to track the implementation of the national plan for the reduction of GHG emissions, as well as to track all additional government measures implemented for the reduction of GHG emissions.<br />",1

"Overview","Pledge content","Papua New Guinea communicated that it is aiming to decrease its GHG emissions by at least 50 per cent before 2030, while becoming carbon-neutral before 2050.<br /> Papua New Guinea provided the following conditions for the communication of its intention to achieve the aforementioned emissions reduction.<br /> Preliminary nature of inscription: any actions inscribed hereto by Papua New Guinea are preliminary in nature, are indicative only of aspirational objectives and are subject to paragraphs 133-137 below.<br /> Interim nature of the Copenhagen Accord: Papua New Guinea views the Copenhagen Accord as an interim &quot;stepping stone&quot; agreement designed to facilitate immediate action while supporting the development of a legally binding international treaty on climate change through the ongoing work of the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP. However, Papua New Guinea believes that the lack of finalized rules of procedure under the two-track negotiation process impedes progress and erodes ambition. Therefore, an urgent review must be undertaken by the Parties.<br /> Need for a legally binding treaty: the Party believes that global development and climate objectives are best realized through a legally binding and broadly inclusive international treaty framework that includes, inter alia: science-based global emission reduction targets, leadership by all developed countries related to deep domestic emission cuts and the provision of international support; NAMAs implemented by developing countries subject to their respective capabilities and the provision of adequate, predictable and sustainable international support (finance, capacity-building and technology); appropriate investments to support adaptation measures in developing countries; an effective system for measuring, monitoring, reporting and verification; and a robust compliance regime, etc.<br /> Delivery on pledges and potential: Papua New Guinea's support for the Copenhagen Accord is subject to the immediate mobilization and verification of the pledged USD 30 billion in financial resources from 2010 to 2012 and the rapid establishment of mechanism and governance systems to facilitate its effective implementation and distribution. Further, the Copenhagen Accord must deliver on its promise and potential, including: expanded commitments, actions and sources for emission reductions; an aggregate commitment leading to a peaking of emissions by 2020; the establishment of the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund; a coordinated increase in the funding commitment, building towards total funds of USD 100 billion or more by 2020; a refocus on effective implementation related to Africa, the LDCs, the small island developing States (SIDS) and forests (REDD-plus); and the transition to a framework that facilities a low-carbon economic transition at the national level.<br /> Enabling climate-compatible development: Papua New Guinea intends to finalize an initial Climate-compatible Development Plan designed to promote economic and social development in a manner that eradicates poverty, subject to Article 4, paragraphs 3 and 7, of the Convention and paragraph 2 of the Copenhagen Accord. Further, Papua New Guinea recognizes that NAMAs will be undertaken on the basis of its respective capability and will be further enabled by international support (financial, capacity-building and technological) that is new and additional, predictable and adequate, including voluntary actions by LDCs and SIDS taken on the basis of support as stipulated in paragraph 5 of the Copenhagen Accord. However, neither the Copenhagen Accord nor the draft AWG-LCA text adequately support frameworks for the delivery of finance based on country-led national climate-compatible development plans, thereby necessitating further review, consideration and guidance by the Parties.<br /> Periodic review and update: subject to ongoing national planning processes, Papua New Guinea expects to periodically update relevant sustainable development objectives, 'business as usual' projections, NAMAs, adaptation investments and the resulting requirements for enabling resource mobilization.<br /> Papua New Guinea also provided the following rationale for its support of the Copenhagen Accord.<br /> Commitments and actions covering 80 per cent of global emissions: for the first time, total commitments made by countries, including key sectors such as REDD-plus, represent almost 80 per cent of global emissions. Conversely, less than 25 per cent of global GHG emissions are now represented by signatories to Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol (11 Gt of 46 Gt in 2005).<br /> Potential for global emissions to peak by 2020: if the commitments pledged under the Copenhagen Accord are implemented to their maximum potential domestically in both developed and developing countries, these actions could lead to global emissions peaking by 2020. Conversely, under the Kyoto Protocol, this would be impossible due to technically unfeasible domestic reductions and/or financially unsustainable purchases of CDM offset credits.<br /> Commitment to limit global temperature rise: the Copenhagen Accord expresses a collective commitment to limit the increase in global temperature below 2 &deg;C while agreeing to consider by 2015 the strengthening of long-term goals to limit the temperature rise below 1.5 &deg;C. However, this will require participating Parties to perform at the maximum range or exceed existing commitments. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol cannot achieve a 2 &deg;C limit, let alone a 1.5 &deg;C limit, and will result in a 'business as usual' global temperature increase of 4 &deg;C.<br /> Focus on the most vulnerable: the Copenhagen Accord places appropriate emphasis on the developing countries that are most vulnerable and least able to adapt to the impacts of climate change from the dual metrics of adverse consequences and required economic transitions. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol has channelled less than 5 per cent of CDM resources (number of projects and pipeline credits) to those most vulnerable and least able to adapt, such as the LDCs, SIDS and Africa.<br /> Facilitating economic transformation: the Copenhagen Accord correctly approaches climate change from the perspective of economic transformation for developing countries, facilitated through incentives to develop along low emission pathways (paragraph 7 of the Copenhagen Accord) within the context of sustainable development. Similar policy advances must be incorporated within the outcomes of the AWG-LCA. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol only incentivizes project-oriented and programmatic activities which are insufficient to fulfil the ultimate objectives of the Convention.<br /> Increased funding to enable developing country mitigation: the Copenhagen Accord pledges approximately USD 30 billion from 2010 to 2012 or USD 10 billion per year, with a significant proportion to enable mitigation actions in developing countries. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol, under the primary CDM market, generated USD 6.5 billion in 2008. Therefore, the addition of the Copenhagen Accord, together with the ongoing CDM market, may provide significant and additional emission reductions in developing countries.<br /> Increased funding for adaptation: the Copenhagen Accord pledges approximately USD 30 billion from 2010 to 2012, or USD 10 billion per year; several billion of this total could potentially be used for adaptation actions in developing countries. Conversely, the Kyoto Protocol, under the Adaptation Fund linked to the CDM, currently has at its disposal 7.5 million CERs (CDM credits), worth around USD 125 million.<br /> Legal mandate: the Copenhagen Accord operates under Article 7, paragraph 2(c), of the Convention and Papua New Guinea hereby requests the COP to facilitate the coordination of measures adopted by those Parties inscribing actions to address climate change and its effects, taking into account their differing circumstances, responsibilities and capabilities, and respective commitments.<br />",1
