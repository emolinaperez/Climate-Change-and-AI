If the world will follow 2°C average global temperature increase holding scenario, reduction of emissions by 50% will be necessary while in case of limiting increase to 1.5°C, it will be necessary to reduce emissions by 57% compared to 1990 level;”",1
"Overview","Description of how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention","“While Kenya’s historical emission contribution is negligible, at less than 0.1% of the total global emissions, while the per-capita emissions are less than 1.26 MtCO2eq compared to the global average of 7.58 MtCO2e, Kenya places a high priority on response to climate change. In order to meet the below 2&deg;C objective, all countries will need to undertake mitigation based on the common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in accordance with the Convention.”",1
"Overview","Description of how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention","In terms of the implementation measures, we have searched for coherence with the long-term climate objectives of the country, ensuring that capacity building, development and transfer of technologies, along with climate financing, respond to the priorities established as per the objective of emissions neutrality by 2050.",1
"Overview","Description of how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention","Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) outlines the country's transition to a low carbon and climate resilience future. The NDC describes the enhanced actions and the necessary enabling environment during the 2015-2019 period that will lay the foundation for more ambitious goals beyond 2020, contributing to the concerted effort to prevent 2°C increase in global average temperature and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. ",1
