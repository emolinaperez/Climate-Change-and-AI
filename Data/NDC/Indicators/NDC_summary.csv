The GHG emission reduction targets in this section are all conditional upon international support (financial and technical support) made available. <br><strong>Energy</strong><br> The following three energy sub-sector targets collectively can reduce GHG emissions approximately 78.786 Gg CO2e from energy sector in comparison to BAU scenario in 2030, which is around 40% reduction in comparison to energy sector’s GHG emissions from the BAU scenario. <br>Energy Industry (Electricity Generation)<br><ul><li> By 2030, Renewable Energy Capacity Addition and substituting (replacement) of fossil fuels with Coconut (Copra) Oil based Electricity Generation: transitioning to close to 100% renewable energy in the electricity generation sector.</li></ul><br> Transport<br><ul><li> By 2030, 10% improvement in transport (land and marine) energy efficiency</li><li> Electric Vehicles (e-Mobility): by 2030, (a) Introduce Electric Vehicles (e-buses) for public transportation (10% of total Public Buses); (b) Introduce Electric Cars (e-Cars) in Vanuatu (10% of government fleet); and (c) 1000 Electric Two wheelers (e-bikes) /Three Wheelers (e-rickshaw)</li><li> By 2030, 20 % Bio-diesel (bio-fuel) Blending in Diesel</li><li> By 2030, Milage and Emission Standards for Vehicles</li></ul><br> Other Sectors - Commercial, Institutional and Residential<br><ul><li> By 2030, (a) 100% electricity access by households in off-grid areas; (b) 100% electricity access by public institutions (on- and off-grid); (c) 13% electricity sector end-use efficiency; (d) 14% improve biomass end use (improved cook stoves and drying) efficiency; (e) 65% renewable electricity use by rural tourism bungalows.</li><li> By 2030, installation of 1000 numbers of Biogas Plants for Commercial and Residential Use</li><li> By 2030, Increase Energy Efficiency in Commercial and Residential Sector, (a) 5% increase in Energy Efficiency in Commercial and Residential Sector; and (b) 10 Numbers of Energy Efficient Building (Green Building)</li><li> By 2030, Increase Ecotourism Supported by Local Communities</li></ul><br><strong>AFOLU</strong><br> The impact of below mitigation measures in livestock sub-sector’s net GHG emissions reduction of about 30.977 Gg CO2eq in 2030; which is around 9% lesser than the GHG emissions in BAU scenario.<br>It is to be noted that, actual GHG mitigation potentials of the above measures are not estimated due to lack of availability of data and defined methodology; however, the cumulative impact of these measure will result in higher than the estimate GHG emissions reductions.<br>Livestock<br><ul><li> By 2030, Training and capacity building for livestock farming and pasture management</li><li> By 2030, Converting Pastures to Silvopastural Livestock Systems</li><li> By 2030, International Collaboration to Improve Livestock Efficiency</li></ul><br>Forestry<br><ul><li> The forestry sector in Vanuatu is a net carbon sink.</li><li> Sustainable logging practices are being practiced in Vanuatu for commercial logging.</li><li> Vanuatu is committed to maintaining its forest cover in the country and is expected to remain net carbon negative in future as well.

Based on the results and outcome from the REDD+ initiative, potential mitigation interventions shall be included in future NDC update.<br><strong>Waste</strong><br>With the waste sector mitigation measures, the waste sector’s net GHG emissions will reduce about 29.335 Gg in 2030 in comparison to BAU scenario; which is around 56% lesser than the BAU scenario GHG emissions. It is to be noted that, GHG mitigation potentials for some of the measures identified for the waste sector are not estimated due to lack of data availability of methodology; however, the cumulative impact of the additional measure will result in higher GHG emissions reductions from waste sector. <br> Solid Waste (Municipal Solid Waste)<ul><li>By 2030, Implement Waste to Energy Plant for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): (a) Waste to Energy Plant for Port Villa; (b) Waste to Energy Plant for Luganville; and (c) Waste to Energy Plant for Lenakel.</li><li>By 2030, Introduce Composting for municipal organic waste to produce soil enhancer</li><li>By 2030, Implement Collect, Sort and Export of Recyclable Materials (first phase) for Port Vila</li><li>By 2030, Develop and Implement National Plastics Strategy</li></ul><br>Waste Water<br><ul><li>By 2030, Implement Waste Water Management System in Vanuatu: (a) Centralised Waste water collection and treatment system in municipal area including awareness and capacity building</li><li>By 2030, Improvements to Public and Communal Toilet Facilities including Bio- Toilets”</li></ul><br>The Updated First NDC also includes a component on adaptation.",1
"Overview","NDC summary","With domestic resources, by 2025 Viet Nam will have reduced total GHG emissions by about 7.3% compared to the BAU scenario (equivalent to 52.9 million tonnes of CO2eq), and by 2030 Viet Nam will have reduced total GHG emissions by about 9% compared to the BAU scenario (equivalent to 83.9 million tonnes of CO2eq). The above-mentioned 9% contribution can be increased to 27% by 2030 (equivalent to 250.8 million tonnes of CO2eq) with international support. The adaptation component identifies strategic tasks in order to improve adaptive capacity, enhance resilience, and reduce risks caused by climate change, thus contributes to the achievement of the country’s sustainable development goals.",1
