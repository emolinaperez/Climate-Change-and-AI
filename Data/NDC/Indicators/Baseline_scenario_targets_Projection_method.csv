These are summarised in the schematic below. The Reference (Ref), Low and High scenarios refer to annual GDP growth rates of 5%, 3% and 6%, respectively. The Energy Efficiency (EE) scenario is one where the annual energy intensity drops by 20% compared to 10% in the Reference scenario. This scenario is based on the Reference scenario (scenario 1) with a GDP growth rate of 5% per year, except that in Industry the energy intensity will decrease by 20% per year in all the sub-sectors of industry for motor fuel uses, electricity specific uses and thermal uses except in Agriculture and Others in Manufacturing. This is due to energy efficiency improvement and technology innovation which are likely to occur in the next 25 years.</p><ul><li>The implementation of a National Energy Efficiency Programme includes the following activities:</li><li>Promotion of energy-efficient appliances: target of10% energy savings in 2035</li><li>Promotion of solar water heating: target of 80% of needs in Households, and 80% in Services by 2035,</li><li>New Regulations on the use of air-conditioning, target of 20% energy savings in the service sector,</li><li>New Building Code for Household dwellings (features natural ventilation, roof insulation,..), target of 50% energy savings on fans &amp; AC in households by 2035,</li><li>Promotion of cogeneration (production of hot water from waste heat from electricity generation) in hotels, target to cover 20% of hot water needs by 2035.</li></ul><p>It is assumed that for the period of the study 2010-2035, the population will grow at a constant rate of 1% per year, corresponding to the annual average growth rate (AAGR) for the preceding 10 years. It is assumed that the structure of the GDP is the same as for 2010 throughout the study period 2010-2035.<br /><br />The SEC has revealed that the realistic non-GHG targets that have been proposed in the Energy Policy 2010 should be 15% for diversification of electricity generation using renewables by 2030, and to achieve the energy efficiency scenario given in the figure above.</p><p>In order to calculate the emission reduction potentials of these non-GHG targets applied to the MAED scenario projections, the grid emission factor of Seychelles has been calculated using the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Methodological Tool 07 &ndash; i.e. &ldquo;Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system &#40;Version 04.0&#41;&rdquo;. For electricity supply diversification from renewable energy sources that are intermittent such as wind and solar PV, the combined margin emission factor has been calculated as 0.67887 tCO<sub>2</sub> /MWh. For all other renewable energy sources and end use energy efficiency, the combined margin emission factor has been calculated as 0.65936 tCO<sub>2</sub>/MWh.""</p><p><em><strong>GHG Emission Reductions from Supply Side Diversification and Energy Efficiency</strong></em><br />""Since the supply side diversification in Seychelles is expected to be primarily from solar PV and wind energy (as per the proposal made in the Energy Policy 2010), the combined margin emission factor = 0.67887 has been applied to convert the non-GHG target of 15% renewables in the electricity mix in 2030 into the equivalent amount of GHG emissions. Similarly, the emission factor = 0.65936 tCO<sub>2</sub> /MWh has been applied to obtain the emission reductions associated with demand side energy efficiency gains. The GHG emission scenarios were calculated using a combination of the Reference scenario and the non-GHG targets of 15% RE and 15.5% EE in 2030.""</p><p><em><strong>Transport</strong></em><br />""Projections have been made in the SNC regarding the increase in baseline emissions from road transport sector from 66, 525 tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2005 to 167,087 tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030. The projections correspond to an increase in the number of vehicles from 10,622 in 2005 to 20,000 in 2030. Fossil fuel consumption is expected to increase from 21,324 t (2005) to 53,620 t in 2030. Using a target of 30% reduction in fuel use, which is expected to produce a proportional decrease in GHG emissions, the total emissions arising from road transport is expected to be 116.96 ktCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030. This target corresponds to a reduction in emission of 50.13 ktCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030. Assuming a target of 18% for 2025, the corresponding emission reduction is expected to be 26.5 ktCO<sub>2</sub>.""</p><p><strong>Project-based Approach</strong><br />""The climate change mitigation contribution of Seychelles has been calculated using a combination of outcome- and project-based approaches, while avoiding double accounting. There are projects that are not captured in the outcome targets discussed above, and which might be implemented after 2020. Examples of such projects are solid waste management and end-use energy efficiency in the water sector that is not captured in the EE scenario that is discussed above. The EE in the water sector are not included in the INDC because most measures are expected to be implemented before 2020.""</p><p><strong><em>Solid Waste Management</em></strong><br />""Data regarding methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from the old landfill in Mahe was provided by the SEC. Currently, the emissions are not captured neither for flaring nor for electricity generation. The projected emissions profile of CH<sub>4</sub> is shown in the figure below for the period covering 2012 and 2030. The INDC has included a conservative scenario where only 50% of the emissions are captured for flaring.

"Mitigation","Baseline scenario targets: Projection method","<p>""GHG mitigation projections to 2030 were estimated with 2010 emissions as the baseline against which growth and the impact of mitigation measures were calculated.""</p><p>Saint Lucia&rsquo;s GHG inventory produced for the TNC provided historical emissions data between 2000 and 2010 that align with the 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for conducting emission inventories. Projections to 2030 were developed for each individual source category for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. A single baseline was selected in order to have a single starting point for the mitigation options analysis. The sectors covered were: Energy Demand: Electricity Generation; Transport; Industrial Processes; Agriculture; and Waste. Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) was not included in the baseline projection because of the high degree of uncertainty in developing projections of sources and sinks within this sector. Following a prioritization of all possible mitigation actions, emissions projections were made based on assumed economic growth, changes in population, energy supplies and prices, as well as the adoption of new technologies and the impacts of government policies. Further, it was decided that to balance pursuing an aggressive mitigation target with realistic outcomes for the iNDC, projected emissions reductions from the Energy, Electricity Generation and Transportation sectors only will be considered. Uncertainties over the permanence of projected emissions reductions from the Agro-Forestry, Reforestation and LULUCF sectors, and the absence of decisive international action to phase out HFCs persuaded the exclusion of related projected emissions reductions in this analysis. Further, the small estimated 2030 emissions of 2.1 GgCO<sub>2</sub>-eq persuaded the exclusion of the Waste sector from the analysis, as well as that of Industrial Processes, which was eliminated during the prioritization process because of its small size compared to the rest of the economy. Related emissions are captured under the energy sector.</p>",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16

Indeed, association with the Carbon Fund can provide financial benefits that may compensate for or counterbalance the amounts invested to implement the projects, in such a way as to make the project costs negative.""</p>",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15

"Mitigation","Baseline scenario targets: Projection method","<p>""Quantification of future emissions in Pakistan has been based on possible future scenarios and assumptions, apart from a number of other relevant factors. The country is passing through a unique phase of economic and social development, and is faced with grave challenges, including of a rapidly increasing population and threats to its food security and energy security. Therefore, a detailed analysis of future emissions is based on a wide range of probable scenarios in different sectors. Since GDP growth is considered to have a strong correlation with GHG emission pathways, particularly during the early developmental phase, it is imperative to establish a realistically credible GDP growth scenario for projecting the levels of GHG emission for this period. </p><p>The methodology for quantification of future emissions has been customized to integrate the multiple emerging factors, which historically has not been the practice in Pakistan. The quantification of future emissions based on the 'business as usual' scenario is, however, not consistent with future economic growth and developmental objectives of Pakistan. Hence, the methodology has been suitably adjusted to cater for the emerging needs and the forthcoming parameters in the developmental planning of Pakistan. </p><p>The Vision 2025 document of the Government of Pakistan sets a target of average GDP growth rate of 7 percent until the year 2025, which has been used for the extended period until 2030. Further incremental growth rate due to CPEC investments, infrastructure development and increasing energy demand has been adequately incorporated. Based on this adjusted GDP growth rate, the sectoral growth rates have been calculated, thereby providing the sector-specific basis for quantification of the projected sectoral emissions till the year 2030. Although historical sectoral growth rates have been duly considered, the parameters for future scenarios are considered to be more relevant. </p><p>In an endeavor to fully incorporate possible future prospects and also to undertake the analytical exercise, possible scenarios of emissions growth have been prepared with due care. This helped analyze the overall emissions trajectory on a broad spectrum with comprehensive perspective, leading to the final emissions numbers. Hence, projected emissions for different sectors are believed to be the most representative and quantitatively realistic."" </p>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20
