The Energy Efficiency (EE) scenario is one where the annual energy intensity drops by 20% compared to 10% in the Reference scenario. This scenario is based on the Reference scenario (scenario 1) with a GDP growth rate of 5% per year, except that in Industry the energy intensity will decrease by 20% per year in all the sub-sectors of industry for motor fuel uses, electricity specific uses and thermal uses except in Agriculture and Others in Manufacturing.

Similarly, the emission factor = 0.65936 tCO<sub>2</sub> /MWh has been applied to obtain the emission reductions associated with demand side energy efficiency gains.

The projections correspond to an increase in the number of vehicles from 10,622 in 2005 to 20,000 in 2030. Fossil fuel consumption is expected to increase from 21,324 t (2005) to 53,620 t in 2030. Using a target of 30% reduction in fuel use, which is expected to produce a proportional decrease in GHG emissions, the total emissions arising from road transport is expected to be 116.96 ktCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030. This target corresponds to a reduction in emission of 50.13 ktCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030.

The sectors covered were: Energy Demand: Electricity Generation; Transport; Industrial Processes; Agriculture; and Waste. Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) was not included in the baseline projection because of the high degree of uncertainty in developing projections of sources and sinks within this sector. Following a prioritization of all possible mitigation actions, emissions projections were made based on assumed economic growth, changes in population, energy supplies and prices, as well as the adoption of new technologies and the impacts of government policies. Further, it was decided that to balance pursuing an aggressive mitigation target with realistic outcomes for the iNDC, projected emissions reductions from the Energy, Electricity Generation and Transportation sectors only will be considered. Uncertainties over the permanence of projected emissions reductions from the Agro-Forestry, Reforestation and LULUCF sectors, and the absence of decisive international action to phase out HFCs persuaded the exclusion of related projected emissions reductions in this analysis. Further, the small estimated 2030 emissions of 2.1 GgCO<sub>2</sub>-eq persuaded the exclusion of the Waste sector from the analysis, as well as that of Industrial Processes, which was eliminated during the prioritization process because of its small size compared to the rest of the economy.

The country is passing through a unique phase of economic and social development, and is faced with grave challenges, including of a rapidly increasing population and threats to its food security and energy security. Therefore, a detailed analysis of future emissions is based on a wide range of probable scenarios in different sectors. Since GDP growth is considered to have a strong correlation with GHG emission pathways, particularly during the early developmental phase, it is imperative to establish a realistically credible GDP growth scenario for projecting the levels of GHG emission for this period. </p><p>The methodology for quantification of future emissions has been customized to integrate the multiple emerging factors, which historically has not been the practice in Pakistan. The quantification of future emissions based on the 'business as usual' scenario is, however, not consistent with future economic growth and developmental objectives of Pakistan. Hence, the methodology has been suitably adjusted to cater for the emerging needs and the forthcoming parameters in the developmental planning of Pakistan. </p><p>The Vision 2025 document of the Government of Pakistan sets a target of average GDP growth rate of 7 percent until the year 2025, which has been used for the extended period until 2030.

Based on this adjusted GDP growth rate, the sectoral growth rates have been calculated, thereby providing the sector-specific basis for quantification of the projected sectoral emissions till the year 2030.
