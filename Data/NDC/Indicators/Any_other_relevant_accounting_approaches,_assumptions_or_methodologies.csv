Les mesures cibl&eacute;es concernent la protection des espaces forestiers, la d&eacute;forestation, le reboisement, afforestation, l&rsquo;agroforesterie et l&rsquo;arboriculture tout en investissant les efforts n&eacute;cessaires pour r&eacute;duire la consommation de bois provenant de for&ecirc;ts.

The guidelines and the 2006 IPCC software were used to estimate emissions. The changes between the IPCC categories were determined by remote sensing supported by traditional mapping and other means such as forest inventories to track key variables responsible for emissions and removals. This last set of terms are:<ul> <li>The reduction of wood collected for various uses;</li> <li>Curbing deforestation rates;</li> <li>Better management of forests;</li> <li>Preservation of protected areas;</li> <li>The conservation of forest reserves;</li> <li>Agroforestry;</li> <li>Arboriculture;</li> <li>Reforestation;</li> <li>Better control of forest and prairie fires.</li> </ul> <p>The forestry sector was particularly targeted because it is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases and it also offers a great possibility for carbon sequestration in the country. The targeted measures concern the protection of forested areas, deforestation, reforestation, afforestation, agroforestry and arboriculture while concentrating efforts to reduce the consumption of wood from forests. A holistic approach was conceived for sustainable forestry taking into consideration the needs of the population for its fuelwood and other needs. Thus Comoros plans to reforest approximately 12,000 ha during the period from 2018 to 2030. The area under agroforestry and arboriculture will evolve at a rate of 200 ha per year from 2018 to 2030.

Increment of forest cover up to 60% of national land area was suggested by the MAFF. According to the received information, this target is agreed with the “Rectangular Strategy IV, angle 2 (60% of forest cover is maintained)”.</li> li>The FOLU NDC Scenario 2: Reduction 50% of historical emission by 2030 (REDD+ programme); This target is based on the REDD+ national strategy which was included due to the suggestions of REDD+ Technical Secretariat (RTS) and the Department of Climate Change. The main assumption of the calculation was to reduce historical emissions from the forest sector by half (76.3 million tCO2e) by 2030 (38.1 million tCO2e), with an average annual reduction of 21 million tCO2e/year.</li> <li>The FOLU NDC Scenario 3: INDC emission reduction (INDC, 2015) - (4.7 tCO2e/ha/year).This scenario was based on the FOLU sector target presented in the country’s INDC report. The INDC target was also developed in the expectation of maintaining 60% forest cover of the total land area. However, the considered base year was 2010. The effort necessary to increase the forest cover was less (from 57% forest cover in 2010 to 60% in 2030. The increment is 3%). Therefore, emission reduction for the increasing 1 hectare of forest cover was estimated as 4.7 tCO2e/ha/year in INDC. However, actual forest cover is around 42% in 2020. The 18% of forest cover increment should be applied to achieve 60% target in 2030. Here It was observed how much emission reduction can be achieved using the same emission factor value (4.7 tCO2e/ha/year) in the current circumstances.</li></ul>""",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11
