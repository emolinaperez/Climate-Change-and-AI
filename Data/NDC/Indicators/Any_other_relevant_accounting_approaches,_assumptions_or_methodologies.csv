The targeted measures concern the protection of forested areas, deforestation, reforestation, afforestation, agroforestry and arboriculture while concentrating efforts to reduce the consumption of wood from forests. A holistic approach was conceived for sustainable forestry taking into consideration the needs of the population for its fuelwood and other needs. Thus Comoros plans to reforest approximately 12,000 ha during the period from 2018 to 2030. The area under agroforestry and arboriculture will evolve at a rate of 200 ha per year from 2018 to 2030.

The main FOLU sector targets were considered to developed mitigation scenarios.<br>Appendix 5: NDC Senarios in the updated First NDC details that the FOLU sector has three NDC scenarios, as follows:<ul><li>FOLU NDC Scenario 1: 60% forest cover by 2030 â (MAFF, Rectangular Strategy IV). Increment of forest cover up to 60% of national land area was suggested by the MAFF. According to the received information, this target is agreed with the âRectangular Strategy IV, angle 2 (60% of forest cover is maintained)â.</li> ï¼li>The FOLU NDC Scenario 2: Reduction 50% of historical emission by 2030 (REDD+ programme); This target is based on the REDD+ national strategy which was included due to the suggestions of REDD+ Technical Secretariat (RTS) and the Department of Climate Change. The main assumption of the calculation was to reduce historical emissions from the forest sector by half (76.3 million tCO2e) by 2030 (38.1 million tCO2e), with an average annual reduction of 21 million tCO2e/year.</li> <li>The FOLU NDC Scenario 3: INDC emission reduction (INDC, 2015) - (4.7 tCO2e/ha/year).This scenario was based on the FOLU sector target presented in the countryâs INDC report. The INDC target was also developed in the expectation of maintaining 60% forest cover of the total land area. However, the considered base year was 2010. The effort necessary to increase the forest cover was less (from 57% forest cover in 2010 to 60% in 2030. The increment is 3%). Therefore, emission reduction for the increasing 1 hectare of forest cover was estimated as 4.7 tCO2e/ha/year in INDC. However, actual forest cover is around 42% in 2020. The 18% of forest cover increment should be applied to achieve 60% target in 2030. Here It was observed how much emission reduction can be achieved using the same emission factor value (4.7 tCO2e/ha/year) in the current circumstances.</li></ul>""",1
