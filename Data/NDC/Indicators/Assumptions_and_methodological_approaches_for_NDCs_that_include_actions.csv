"Mitigation","Assumptions and methodological approaches for NDCs that include actions","<p>""A dynamic baseline will be developed on basis of a combination of two scenarios. One scenario assumes economic diversification with a robust contribution of oil export revenues, and the other on an accelerated domestic industrialization based on sustainable utilization of all indigenous resources including oil, gas and minerals.""</p> <p>""Two scenarios applied for determining dynamic baselines for the period 2000&ndash;2030 are differentiated into three time-periods. First time period covers the years 2000-2015. The year 2000 is used because it is the year that most recent inventory data obtained using the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is available (second national communications). Second and third time- periods are from 2016 to 2020 and 2021-2030 respectively.</p> <p>3.1. Scenario 1: Economic diversification with a robust contribution from oil and its derivatives export revenues. Export revenues channelled into investments in high valueadded sectors such as financial services, medical services, tourism, education, renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to enhance economic growth. Ambitions outlined in this INDC are set under this scenario.</p> <p>3.2. Scenario 2: Accelerated domestic industrialization based on sustainable utilization of oil and gas. A heavy industrial base built to use domestic oil resources asfeedstock or energy source. Increasing contributions of petrochemical, cement, mining and metal production industries to the national economy. Economic growth will be much slower under this scenario, and will be difficult for the Kingdom to finance its INDC ambitions with domestic resources. In this case, this INDC will be adjusted to account for this scenario.</p> <p>3.3. The main difference between the two baseline scenarios is the allocation of oil produced for either domestic consumption or export. While exported oil will not contribute to the GHG emissions of Saudi Arabia, the domestic consumption will increase its GHG emissions. For the ex-ante estimations, the baseline is determined based on differently weighted combinations of the two scenarios. Between 2016 and 2020, Saudi Arabia reserves the right to further elaborate on its INDC and make additional submissions to&nbsp;account for these scenarios. During the run-up to the validity period of the INDC, the baseline scenarios will be updated.""</p>",2
"Mitigation","Assumptions and methodological approaches for NDCs that include actions","<p>""According to the GHG inventory (Second National Communication, 2006) and the CARBOVEG-GB Project (2010) Guinea-Bissau is an absolute sink of greenhouse gases, given the high potential for sequestration of its forest sector.</p> <p>It is known, through the above-referenced inventories, that the main responsible for emissions in Guinea-Bissau is the change in the use of land and forests. Deforestation is responsible for emitting large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. The estimates show a decline of around 625,000 m<sup>3</sup> of wood per year.</p> <p>Therefore, the main mitigation measure to be adopted by the country, which may be a national contribution, is related to reforestation.

Only then would it be possible to perform calculations that would allow an analysis of the mitigation potential for Guinea-Bissau, allowing at the same time the making of a proposal for an ambitious and fair contribution.""</p>",2

"Mitigation","Assumptions and methodological approaches for NDCs that include actions","<p>""Currently, Sudan has neither an overall baseline emission scenario for all sources of emissions and removals in the three sectors covered in this contribution, nor sectoral baselines that can be used to define quantitative mitigation actions and assess their overall effects. As such, Sudan is planning to establish a baseline as part of its proposal for a low-carbon development strategy, of which its preparation is still pending availability of financial and technical support. Sudan is currently embarking on the implementation of its Readiness Preparation Proposal for REDD+, which will also enable Sudan to establish reference emissions levels / forest reference levels (ERL/FRL) for the forestry sector. For the implementation of the intended contribution included in this INDC, Sudan foresees that sectoral or project level specific baselines should be established to enable a robust assessment of the effect of these mitigation contributions.</p> <p>The trend in Sudan&rsquo;s total GHG emissions indicates an increase by about 8%; from 72,014 Gg of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) in 1995 to 77,650 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2000. In 2000, the total GHG emissions in the three sectors that are covered in Sudan&rsquo;s INDC are estimated at 8,539Gg from energy, 9,392 Gg from LUCF1 and 2,015 Gg from waste. The major drivers for these changes in GHG emission levels are attributed to, among others, changes in emissions from the energy sector, which increased by roughly 10%, mainly due to increased fossil fuel consumption.</p> <p>Regarding the waste sector, emissions from waste management have more than doubled, mainly due to greater amounts of municipal solid waste sent to landfill sites. There are a number of limitations and shortcomings affecting the GHG estimations in the three sectors, mainly related to serious problems of data availability and quality, and partly related to technical capacity and application of methods.</p> <p>Energy consumption in Sudan is expected to reach over 13 million tons of oil-equivalent (TOE) by 2030. Diesel and gasoline, used primarily in the transport sector, dominate future growth in fossil fuels and account for over 70% of energy use by 2030. GHG emissions associated with this energy use trajectory are expected to reach just over 24 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent by 2030, a 6-fold increase from year 2000 levels (see Figure 4-2). The transport and electricity sectors together account for most of the growth in GHG emissions in Sudan, with these two sectors responsible for around 70% of projected GHG emissions by 2030 (SNC 2013). The current source of electrical power in Sudan is a mix of hydropower and thermal power generation plants. The thermal power generation is composed of steam turbines, diesel engine, and steam turbines which have lower-efficiency of about 14% compared with gas high efficiency diesel-fired combined cycle unit up to 45 %. Therefore, there is a need to shift to the high efficiency diesel- fired combined cycle unit but the initial cost is high, predominantly due to the lack of available infrastructure for LNG importation and as well as the necessary high and long-term investments.</p> <p>Sustainable land use management faces great challenges in Sudan mainly due to poor policy coordination across sectors (i.e., forestry, agriculture, range and protected lands). Additional factors include the absence of unified legislation, absence of high-resolution land use maps, inadequate consideration of the socio-economic factors, and weak implementation of the existing legislation and policies by the sectors. This land use context has led to serious environmental problems such as overgrazing, over cultivation and reduced land productivity which in turn have led to rural poverty, and rural-urban migration patterns that cannot be sustained in the long-term. In the absence of concerted efforts to address these issues, land degradation is expected to worsen over the next 30 years. Factors such as unsustainable wood fuel use, increasing demand for agriculture and grazing resources, and mismanaged of forests and land use has led to the current deforestation rate, which is estimated at 2.2 of the total land area.""</p>",2

Petroleum products play an important role in the country's energy supply since it is the main source of fuel for transport and electricity generation, notwithstanding its negative environment consequences. In 2010, Total Energy Supply (TES) in The Gambia was 407,926 tons of oil equivalents (toe) according to UNIDO figures. As shown in Figure below, five conditional mitigation options have been identified and analyzed under the Energy Sector.

Current municipal solid waste generation in The Gambia amounts to approximately 438 tons/day and is expected to reach 1,295 tons/day in 2025 (World Bank 2012). Waste management is a major concern for Gambian Authorities, given that roughly 90% of waste is currently disposed in open dumps (e.g. Bakoteh Dump Site). This leads to severe environmental consequences (Sanneh et al. 2011), which can be exacerbated by the expected growth in waste generation volume in the future. Enhancement of the waste collection system is hindered by lack of vehicles. Specialized vehicles are too expensive to buy and maintain for the municipalities who are responsible for waste management. Over 40% of the population lives in the Greater Banjul Area (GBA). As such, the Government included in its NAMA agreed list the implementation of an Integrated Management initiative for solid and liquid waste in the GBA, which is expected to reduce emissions significantly but is also associated with an estimated implementation cost of USD 68 million.</p> <p>Under waste management, combined greenhouse gas emission reductions of 141 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2020, 239.7 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2025, and 413.7 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2030 will be achieved through conditional methane capture, and waste recycling and composting.
