"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","Canada intends to include the LULUCF sector in its accounting of GHG emissions by using either the 2005 base year or a reference level. Non-anthropogenic emissions and related removals resulting from natural disturbances will be excluded, and accounting for harvested wood products would follow a production approach <br /> In its BR1, the Party specified that it would use an approach based on the LULUCF reporting categories under the Convention.",1

"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","For the United States the target is economy-wide and will create incentives to reduce net emissions from all sectors that have mitigation potential, including the LULUCF sector. The United States will undertake a comprehensive, land-based approach that takes advantage of the broadest array of mitigation actions <br /> The United States stated in their 2012 submission that comprehensive emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector will be accounted using a net-net approach and a 2005 base year, including a production approach to account for harvested wood products. Methodological approaches for excluding emissions resulting from non-anthropogenic natural disturbances are under consideration. The Party acknowledges that, in accordance with the full land-based approach, LULUCF contributed around 1,057 Mt CO2 eq net removals in 2005, which is around 15 per cent of the total emissions from all other sectors. It also acknowledges that this contribution comprises a relatively significant portion of the total emissions and removals of the United States.*<br /> *Further details available at &lt;http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg-lca/items/5928.php&gt;.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","Iceland intends to reach its 2020 target mainly through domestic action in reducing emissions and increasing carbon sequestration. Mitigation efforts in the LULUCF sector are expected to play a major role, since there is almost no mitigation potential in the energy sector.<br /> Actions in the LULUCF sector will allow Iceland to take on targets comparable with other developed countries, but large changes in LULUCF rules might call for a recalculation of Iceland's target.<br /> The Party plans to follow an activity-based approach, including afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and revegetation activities, while the inclusion of forest management and wetland drainage and rewetting is yet to be confirmed.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","In defining its target, New Zealand includes afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities, while the inclusion of forest management is yet to be confirmed. It also specified that as per the conditions of New Zealand's target range, an effective set of rules for LULUCF would include the flexible land use,'afforestation-reforestation debit- credit' and harvested wood product rules. <br />New Zealand's 10-20 per cent target is conditional on an effective set of rules for LULUCF",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","In defining its targets for 2020, Australia considered that these targets refer to its net emissions from the sector and source categories included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol as well as from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities, for the base year (2000) and 2020. The 25 per cent target is conditional on the inclusion of forests (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries) and the land sector in the global agreement, while the 15 per cent target is conditional on progress for their inclusion <br /> In its BR1, Australia reported that it would use the activity-based approach for including emissions and removals from LULUCF in its target. The Party also reported that, in 2013, it announced its decision to further broaden the coverage of the land sector to include net emissions from cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation activities within its second commitment period target under the Kyoto Protocol. <br />",1

"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","Liechtenstein, in its BR1, clarified that the contribution of LULUCF to its target will be calculated using the land- based approach.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","Monaco reports that LULUCF does not play a major role in achieving the target as there is no forest or agricultural activity in the country. However, to calculate the contribution of LULUCF towards its target, the land-based approach will be used.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","Norway reported in its BR1 that, as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, it will follow the established rules for accounting for LULUCF using an activity-based approach under the Convention as well. Norway estimated that the contribution of LULUCF to its target is of the order of 6 per cent of 1990 emissions based on the current LULUCF accounting rules under the Kyoto Protocol, which is equivalent to 3 Mt CO2 eq. In the event that the LULUCF rules change, Norway would modify its target for 2020 with a view to maintaining the overall high ambition of this target.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","Switzerland uses the rules of the Kyoto Protocol for its target under the Convention, but has not yet estimated possible LULUCF contribution to its target. However, using the rules under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and applying the accounting approach of the forest management reference level, emissions or removals from forest management in Switzerland are estimated to be zero in 2020. <br /> Reporting of LULUCF under the Convention follows a comprehensive land- based approach. In the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Switzerland is accounting for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, of the Kyoto Protocol and forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4. Accounting for additional activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, of the Kyoto Protocol in the second commitment period is yet to be decided",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","The EU does not envisage a contribution from LULUCF for its lower target of 20 per cent. Moving to its possible higher target of 30 per cent would require some contribution from LULUCF, which is estimated to be a net sink over that period. However, as a Party with a commitment for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has to account for LULUCF following an activity-based approach.*<br /> *It seems unlikely that the EU will define its target under the Convention using an approach different from that used under the Kyoto Protocol. This suggests that the lower target set by the EU would cover all sectors, but LULUCF will be treated on the accounting side like in the first commitment period, although the EU did not make a formal submission in that regard.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector","The Russian Federation acknowledges the need for an appropriate accounting for the potential of its LULUCF sector in meeting its target and that LULUCF can contribute to a net removal of 121.1 Mt CO2 eq per year according to current rules. However, this estimate is uncertain given that the forest sink could be expected to decrease by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent by 2020.",1
