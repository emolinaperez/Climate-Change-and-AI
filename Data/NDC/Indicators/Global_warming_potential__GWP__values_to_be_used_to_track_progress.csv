No single metric can accurately compare all consequences of different emissions, and all have limitations and uncertainties"". The IPCC also states that the Global Temperature Potential (GTP) metric is better suited to target-based policies, while the GWP metric is not directly related to a temperature limit such as the 2&deg;C target. Taking this into account, the GTP metric is the most consistent with contributions to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2&deg;C above preindustrial levels.</p> <p>With a view to assuring full transparency, clarity and understanding, Brazil decided to communicate this iNDC using GWP-100 (IPCC AR5), prior to COP-21. Consistent with the 2&deg;C temperature goal and in light of science, Brazil is providing estimates to correspond to GTP-100, with IPCC AR5 values.</p> <p>Brazil's iNDC is consistent with emission levels of 1.0 GtCO2e (GTP-100; IPCC AR5) in 2025 and 0.8 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GTP-100; IPCC AR5)in 2030. This represents reductions of 43% and 52%, respectively, compared to estimated emission levels of 1.7 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GTP-100; IPCC AR5) in 2005. These reductions translate to reductions of 37% and 43% when expressed in GWP-100 (IPCC AR5).""</p>",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14
