"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Although rules on the use of international offsets have not been finalized, Canada does not assume or provide for significant use of Kyoto Protocol mechanisms for its 2020 target. According to preliminary estimates, use of mechanisms could account for less than 5 per cent of total reductions by 2020",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Australia's targets represent net emissions and include credible Kyoto-compliant units from emission reduction activities overseas as to be reflected in the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units <br /> On the use of carbon credits, for Australia the 15 per cent target is conditional on access to deeper and broader carbon markets and the 25 per cent target is conditional on global action that mobilizes greater financial resources, including from major developing economies, and to a fully functioning global carbon market. Australia assumes that all available units from international market mechanisms, including the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, will contribute to meeting its 2020 targets. The use of these units in Australia's Carbon Pricing Mechanism will be governed by domestic legislation and regulations. Under this legislation from 2015, certain credits from the CDM may be used to meet obligations under the Carbon Pricing Mechanism, and these credits would be counted towards Australia's targets. <br />",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Cameroon communicated that it will undertake NAMAs through REDD and CDM projects, reforestation, and sector-specific mitigation actions developed as part of its National Mitigation Strategy.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","CDM, JI, IET, carry-over, REDD; New Zealand expects to meet its target through a mixture of domestic emission reductions, including through afforestation, reforestation and forest management, and the purchase of emission reductions in other countries, including carbon credits from all available existing and potential new market-based mechanisms. <br />New Zealand's 10-20 per cent target is conditional on the full recourse to a broad and efficient international carbon market",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Colombia has estimated a total emissions reduction of up to 54.8 Mt CO2 by 2020 through the implementation of the CDM in the energy, forest, industrial, transport and waste management sectors.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Gerogia communicated NAMAs to: support the CDM as one of the most important means for further cooperation in the field of NAMAs.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Iceland intends to fulfill its pledge mostly or even fully through domestic efforts and expects the role of market-based mechanisms in achieving its target to be small. However, Iceland does not rule out the need to buy offsets<br /> Although no acquiring of carbon credits through mechanisms is expected in its climate mitigation action plan, Iceland will retain the option to engage in carbon markets in addition to its participation in the EU ETS. The Party anticipates zero carry-over of credits from the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. <br />",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","In addition to the implementation of domestic measures, Monaco will purchase CERs and does not intend to use the carry-over of AAUs or the purchase of foreign AAUs. <br />Monaco intends to use the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, in particular the CDM, in achieving its target",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Liechtenstein is planning to use Kyoto Protocol mechanisms as an additional tool for being in compliance with the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. The Party provided preliminary estimates in the range of 10 per cent to 40 per cent <br />The Party explained that its aim is to prioritize domestic GHG emission reductions. In case the envisaged reductions would be higher than 20 per cent by 2020, Liechtenstein would need to increase its use of carbon credits in order to achieve the respective target. The precise amount of additional credits required has not yet been estimated. To that end, Liechtenstein envisages taking the option of continuing its engagement with the Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","National activities of the CDM established under the Kyoto Protocol would not be excluded.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","On the use of market-based mechanisms, Norway estimates that about two thirds of emission reductions in 2020 would be achieved through domestic emission reduction efforts, which is equivalent to 15-17 Mt CO2 eq, with the remaining part coming from CDM, JI, international emissions trading and any other market-based mechanisms that may be established under the Convention. If Norway should move to its higher target of 40 per cent reduction, this would entail considerable use of carbon credits. <br /> An important feature of Norwegian climate change policy is the flexible and cost-effective Kyoto Protocol based approach. Norway underlined the importance of pursuing various approaches, including opportunities to use markets post-2012. <br /> Availability of flexible mechanisms is an underlying premise for Norway's emission targets. Norway will continue to make use of the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Participation of Belarus in the mechanisms is conditional on access to other Kyoto Protocol mechanisms",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Peru also stated that its mitigation measures do not exclude the use of the CDM or other market-based mechanisms which could be created under the Convention.",1
"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","Switzerland plans to use carbon credits from the mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol (CERs and ERUs) and from the new market-based mechanism under the Convention (see para. 98 below) to achieve its target under the Convention. The estimate of the amount of carbon credits to be used is not available yet. The Swiss CO2 Law for the 2013-2020 period defines Switzerland's -20 per cent target as domestic; however, carbon credits are planned to be used in some limited cases.* In accordance with the same law, in addition to the carbon credits that will be used for achieving the -20 per cent target, such credits are also planned to be used for up to 75 per cent of the additional emission reductions beyond the -20 per cent target by 2020 compared with 1990. Switzerland does not support the use of AAUs outside of the Kyoto system. <br /> *In its submission, Switzerland lists the following cases: Ðfossil fuel power plants, the ETS, companies exempted from the CO2 levy that are not involved in the ETS, and the sanction mechanismÓ.",1

"Mitigation","Assumptions related to international market mechanisms","The EU in the context of the AWG-LCA is more ambitious in the use of market-based mechanisms compared with such use in the context of the Kyoto Protocol: for example, inclusion of international aviation, higher CDM quality standards, supplementarity defined, recognition of early action, no carry-over of assigned amount units, a single base year of 1990, annual compliance cycle, higher penalties for non-compliance in emissions trading sectors, taking into account the direct and indirect effects of biofuels on land-use change <br /> CERs, ERUs and possible recognition of units from new market-based mechanisms; for the use of units the EU ETS is capped at 50 per cent of the required reduction below 2005 levels; other sectors: annual use capped at 3-4 per cent of each member State's non-ETS GHG emissions in 2005 <br /> No use of surplus AAUs from the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol to meet the targets set in EU legislation, but EU ETS allows for banking of surplus EU emission allowances into subsequent periods <br /> The EU in the context of the AWG-LCA is more ambitious in the use of market-based mechanisms compared with such use in the context of the Kyoto Protocol: for example, inclusion of international aviation, higher CDM quality standards, supplementarity defined, recognition of early action, no carry-over of assigned amount units, a single base year of 1990, annual compliance cycle, higher penalties for non-compliance in emissions trading sectors, taking into account the direct and indirect effects of biofuels on land-use change <br /> CERs, ERUs and possible recognition of units from new market-based mechanisms; for the use of units the EU ETS is capped at 50 per cent of the required reduction below 2005 levels; other sectors: annual use capped at 3-4 per cent of each member State's non-ETS GHG emissions in 2005 <br /> No use of surplus AAUs from the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol to meet the targets set in EU legislation, but EU ETS allows for banking of surplus EU emission allowances into subsequent periods",1
