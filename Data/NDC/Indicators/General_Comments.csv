Within the period of 1935-2016 the total precipitation decreased by about 9 per cent (with faster decrease after 1996) which necessitates corresponding adaptation measures in agriculture and better water management;</li><li>The average air temperature has significantly increased compared to the 1961-1990 annual average: by 1.03°C during 1929-2012, and during 1929-2016 this increase made 1.23°C.</li></ul>",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12
