"Mitigation","Baseline scenario targets: Emission drivers included and assumptions and data sources for key drivers","<p>""Therefore, the model could be described as a simulation model, designed to develop the GHG emissions projections based on some specific sectoral assumptions and other, more general, economic assumptions which link the three (3) sectors. The main features of the model are:</span> <br /> <ul> <li>The economic module, which forecasts the general economic growth of Trinidad and Tobago and that of the sectors, according to some assumptions and scenarios generated.</li> <li>The sectoral submodels, which develop the technical specificities of every sector, according to the forecasts of the economic module.</li> <li>The emissions module, which converts the activity data into GHG emissions, according to the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.</li> </ul> <p>The development of the future scenarios is based on projections of the World Bank for Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean. The scenario developed shows a lower economic growth and is therefore defined as the conservative scenario, while the growth expected for the Caribbean is higher, so it was used as the baseline for the optimistic scenario. The scenarios have an important influence on the GHG emissions. Firstly, it is due to the relationship between the demand growth and the GHG emissions. And secondly, because in a long term projection, structural transformations of the economy take place, reflecting the differences between the relative weights of the economic sectors, and affecting the GHG emissions.""</p>",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21

Also, in the BAU scenario, electricity production is decreasing by 1.3% per year due to the degradation of power plants. Finally, exploration activities in the offshore oil and gas sector has started in 2020 with the drilling of the first deep water well. However emission-intensive production and development operations are not expected to start before 2028, potentially contributing to the increase in GHG emissions level. </br>For transport emissions, it was assumed that the fleet will be increasing by 3% annually. As for agriculture, emissions remain stable in the BAU scenario. As for forestry, due to an increase in deforestation, increase in forest fires and urban sprawl, the LULUCF sink is limited at a rate of 1% per year. Both the agriculture and forestry assumptions were made based on the time series analysis. As for waste emissions, generation is estimated to increase with population growth and with waste generation per capita increasing from 1.05 to 1.30 kg/capita/day.<br>Finally, industrial emissions are estimated to increase by 2.5% annually.
