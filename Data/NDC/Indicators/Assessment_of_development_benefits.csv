PAMs with the highest share in the number of new domestic green jobs are: Retrofit of existing residential buildings (42%), Construction of passive houses (21%), RES without incentives (6%) and Solar thermal collectors (8%).</li><li>Gender: Based on the types of the newly created jobs, very basic analysis indicated that at least 27% of the jobs in 2035 can be assigned to women. Furthermore, the PAMs were analyzed in light of their gender responsiveness. It was found that there are number of PAMs where gender disaggregated approach would improve the implementation, particularly the PAMs related to subsidizing mitigation technologies and awareness rising. Subsequently, with an aim to make the enhanced NDC gender-responsive, the respective PAMs were redesigned and gender indictors included. Most prominent example is redesign of the “first come, first served” subsidy model to a gender informed model that supported 10,000 most vulnerable households in most affected cities in the country to replace their heating technology with more efficient one.</li></ul><br>Sustainable Development Goals: ""Aiming at understanding the contribution of the enhanced NDC to the national SD agenda, the SCAN tool and the newly developed Q-SCAN tool were applied to identify and quantify their synergies and trade-offs.

The pattern of the integral scores follows the pattern of the sector Electricity & Heat, which indicates that this sector is dominant in influencing the SDGs. The strongest synergies remain with SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth due to the new job opportunities in renewable energy deployment and in the construction and retrofit market; sustained economic growth, improved economic efficiency per unit of product and sustained support of entrepreneurship. The most significant trade-off is with the SDG 15 Life on land, due to the land requirements from renewable energy projects, potential forest degradation and potential river routes changes.
