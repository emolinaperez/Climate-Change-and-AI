It is in line with the EU objective, in the context of necessary reductions according to the IPCC by developed countries as a group, to reduce its emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990. Furthermore, it is consistent with the need for at least halving global emissions by 2050 compared to 1990. The EU and its Member States have already reduced their emissions by around 19% on 1990 levels while GDP has grown by more than 44% over the same period. As a result, average per capita emissions across the EU and its Member States have fallen from 12 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. in 1990 to 9 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. in 2012 and are projected to fall to around 6 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. in 2030.

In order to implement the distribution of remaining carbon budget that would ensure the stabilization of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Bolivia has proposed a Climate Justice Index for the fair and equitable sharing of the global emissions budget; moreover this means of distribution would impart the carbon budget based on the following indicators:</p> <p>a) <em>Historical responsibility</em>. Includes responsibility for the cumulative emissions since the pre-industrial era (1750-2010).<br />b) <em>Ecological Footprint</em>. A calculation based on the amount of land, water and forest people of the countries need to satisfy all the goods consumed and to assimilate the waste they generate.<br />c) <em>Capacity development</em>. Represents the conditions of economic and social development of each country.<br />d) <em>Technological capacity</em>. Measures the ability of countries considering their technological development based on expenditures on Research &amp; Development and industrial performance of each of them, considering their capacity to produce and export goods with high technology.</p> <p>This index fairly determines the effort required by each country to stay within the budget of remaining emissions that corresponds to them. This implies that countries with high historical responsibility, high ecological footprints, greater development and greater technological capabilities, have a smaller share of the budget.</p> <p>As a result of implementing the Bolivian index proposal, non- Annex I countries would have a total of 89% of the budget and Annex I countries only 11%.

The estimated global warming of 2&deg;C would imply for Angola severe economic losses for Agriculture sector, a sector that contributes to over 8% of the country GDP and at threat to the stability of food security. The Government of Angola has been diverting own funds to carry out implementation of complementary initiatives addressing these Climate Change impacts.</p> <p>In addition, Angola is the third-largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa and a net exporter of fossil fuels, and by now the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria. According to the country's Initial National Communication (INC) report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) released in 2012 (but based on emission inventory statistics from 2005) Angola only contributed approximately with 66.8 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e of Greenhouse Gas Emissions to the atmosphere. This contribution is meagre and represents a small percentage of current global GHG emissions.

In selecting the actions outlined above, Angola has prioritised those which fit with the growth priorities set out in its national development plans in particular the Angola 2025 Policy Document. In addition, Angola has captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation, not only by prioritising those adaptation activities with significant mitigation co-benefits but also by seeking to minimise the carbon footprint of its adaptation portfolio as a whole. Angola is therefore putting forward Mitigation actions as well as Adaptation measures with mitigation benefits amounting over 15,7 billion USD that align with a low carbon development pathway, which to be fully implemented would require additional international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building.""</p> <p><a title="""" href=""#_ftnref1"">[1]</a>&nbsp;Ministry of Environment.Angola Initial National Communication.(2011) Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).194 p.&nbsp;<br /><a title="""" href=""#_ftnref1"">[2]</a>&nbsp;GHG time series 1990-2012 per capita emissions for world countries http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=GHGts_pc1990- 2012</p>",2

In spite of these challenges, Brazil's current actions in the global effort against climate change represent one of the largest undertakings by any single country to date, having reduced its emissions by 41% (GWP-100; IPCC SAR)in 2012 in relation to 2005 levels.</p> <p>Brazil is nevertheless willing to further enhance its contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention, in the context of sustainable development. Brazil's iNDC represents a progression in relation to its current undertakings, in both the type and levels of ambition, while recognizing that emissions will grow to meet social and development needs.</p> <p>By adopting an economy-wide, absolute mitigation target, Brazil will follow a more stringent modality of contribution, compared to its voluntary actions pre-2020. This contribution is consistent with emission levels of 1.3 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5)in 2025 and 1.2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP-100; IPCC AR5)in 2030, corresponding, respectively, to a&nbsp;reduction of 37% and 43%, based on estimated emission levels of 2.1 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e (GWP- 100; IPCC AR5) in 2005.</p> <p>In relation to Brazil's existing national voluntary commitment, which aims to achieve gross emissions of approximately 2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020, this iNDC represents an additional gross reduction of approximately 19% in 2025.

Similarly, current human activities around the world will affect the climate system over the next centuries.</p> <p>In order to build a fair and equitable global response to climate change, it is therefore of central importance to link cause (net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions) and effect (temperature increase and global climate change).</p> <p>The global mean surface temperature increase due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is an objective criterion to measure climate change, serving the purpose of establishing upper limits to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p> <p>The specific and relative role of each actor's emissions to global climate change can be determined using the global mean surface temperature as an indicator. Each individual actor's contribution to temperature increase should take into consideration differences in terms of starting points, approaches, economic structures, resource bases, the need to maintain sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances.</p> <p>Establishing the series, in all sectors, of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks allows the estimation of the relative share of total temperature increase attributable to an individual country. The relative responsibility of a given country in relation to the global mean surface temperature increase can be estimated with a high level of confidence. Hence, the marginal relative contribution to the global average surface temperature increase is a relevant measure to evaluate responsibility in the global effort to limit temperature increase to 2&deg;C compared to preindustrial levels.</p> <p>Brazil's mitigation efforts are of a type, scope and scale at least equivalent to the iNDCs of those developed countries most responsible for climate change. In view of the above, and based on available tools, it is evident that Brazil's iNDC, while consistent with its national circumstances and capabilities, is far more ambitious than what would correspond to Brazil's marginal relative responsibility for the global average temperature increase.""</p>",2

Some of these challenges can be addressed through actions that at the same time have a potential to contribute to mitigation and adaptation to climate change. In the past, peace processes elsewhere in the world have been associated to negative impacts on the environment, due to, among other things, migration patterns that increase pressure on natural resources in the most vulnerable areas, often resulting in increased deforestation. These potential impacts have been taken into account in post-conflict scenarios in different regions.</p><p>Adaptation measures aiming at planning a rational use of ecosystem services that have been prioritized, such as water resources, allow for a better management and use of those resources and ensure the dynamics of supply and demand in the country.

By prioritising initiatives such as these, Ethiopia is maximising its mitigation potential and contributing towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention, whilst simultaneously supporting its sustainable development goals.</p> <p>An important component of Ethiopia&rsquo;s contribution includes actions to build resilience and enhance adaptation to the impacts of climate change. Given that 80% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, increasing the resilience of agriculture is a priority for Ethiopia. This includes addressing the high levels of vulnerability of the sector to droughts and floods.</p> <p>Ethiopia also seeks to maximise the synergies between adaptation and mitigation, especially involving agriculture and forests. Many of the measures involving forestry and agriculture can provide substantial economic and livelihood benefits. By targeting actions in these sectors, Ethiopia is seizing the opportunities that ambitious climate action brings, helping to reduce both its future emissions and its vulnerability to climate impacts.</p> <p>Ethiopia recognises the negative impact of climate change on health, economic growth and natural resource conservation and that is why it has committed to undertake such ambitious action using its domestic resources. However, there are enormous untapped opportunities for increased action on climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation, in Ethiopia. For more than 80% of the abatement potential, abatement costs are less than USD 15 per ton CO<sub>2</sub>e. With additional support to mobilise finance, infrastructure, technology and capacity to undertake and oversee implementation, Ethiopia can realize its full potential to act and increase its contributions even further.""</p>",2

In terms of the provision on Article 3.1 and 4.7, this submission by India represents the utmost ambitious action in the current state of development. Both in terms of cumulative global emissions (only 3%) and per capita emission (1.56 tCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2010), India&rsquo;s contribution to the problem of climate change is limited but its actions are fair and ambitious.&nbsp;</p> <p>The recent decisions of the Government represent a quantum jump in our aspirations in climate change actions starting with the manifold scaling up of our renewable energy targets to the programme on Smart Cities, cleaning of rivers and Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission). The initiatives have demonstrated unparalleled vision and strong political initiatives of the Government. It is expected that developed countries will re-examine their pre 2020 actions in the light of substantial action taken by developing countries like India to ensure that the ambition gap is substantially bridged.</p> <p>Through this INDC, India has shown its commitment to combat climate change and these actions are indeed important contributions to the global effort. However, our efforts to avoid emissions during our development process are also tied to the availability and level of international financing and technology transfer since India still faces complex developmental challenges. The critical issue for developing nations is the gap between their equitable share of the global carbon space and the actual share of carbon space that will be accessible to them. The transfer of appropriate technologies and provision of adequate finance will have to be a determined contribution of the developed countries, which will further enable the developing countries to accomplish and even enhance their efforts. It is expected that developed countries would recognize that without means of implementation and adequate resources, the global vision is but a vacant dream. Addressing the United Nations Summit for the adoption of Post-2015 Development Agenda in September 2015, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi said; &ldquo;We should forge a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all. Equally, we must look for changes in our lifestyles that would make us less dependent on energy and more sustainable in our consumption. It is equally critical to launch a global education programme that prepares our next generation to protect and conserve Nature. I hope that the Developed World will fulfil its financing commitments for development and climate change, without in any way putting both under the same head&rdquo;.</p> <p>India&rsquo;s INDC is fair and ambitious considering the fact that India is attempting to work towards low carbon emission pathway while endeavoring to meet all the developmental challenges the country faces today. Through this submission, India intends to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 % by 2030 from 2005 level. This commitment is further echoed in India&rsquo;s actions in climate change adaptation with setting up its own &lsquo;National Adaptation Fund&rsquo;.</p> <p>The current policy framework also includes a favorable environment for a rapid increase in renewable energy, move towards low carbon sustainable development pathway and adapting to the impacts of climate change.

"Overview","Description of fairness","<p>Jordan communicated the following information describing how its INDC is fair and ambitious.</p><p>""Taking into consideration that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be differentiated according to a Party&rsquo;s responsibility and capability, Jordan believes that its very diversified INDC (a combination of a wide rainbow of outcomes and actions) set together an ambitious target relevance to its small amount of GHGs emission share and development circumstances. The Country&rsquo;s bulk share of GHGs represents only around 0.06% of global total according to a global GHGs analysis conducted in 2010. According to the World Bank, the CO<sub>2</sub> metric tons per capita emission is 3.4 in 2010 as said before. Nevertheless, this small share of GHG did not justify a reluctant reaction of the Country. To the contrary, Jordan, historically, was amongst the most active countries in the region with regard to involvement in international climate change efforts and engagement in response actions as explained above. Most importantly, Jordan has voluntarily developed a national climate change policy in 2013, the first comprehensive policy in the Arab Region and the Middle East. In fact, Jordan willingly developed the National Climate Change Policy for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 2013-2020. This policy is considered the first national-level comprehensive planning initiative to deal with the global phenomenon of climate change in a holistic approach in the Country. However, Jordan, as any of non-Annex I countries, has, so far, no commitments for GHG emission reduction targets. Nevertheless, Jordan believes that there is a large potential for mitigation, even though Jordan&rsquo;s total GHG emissions are very small in absolute terms, and compared to other countries as indicated above.</p><p>From another angle, the modest income levels of the Country along with development challenges described above, mainly poverty and unemployment as two of the most important challenges the Country faces as well as limitation in natural resources and energy challenges along with the demographic characteristics of the Jordanian population all show that the Jordanian development process faces a big challenge in providing basic needs in such a developing country. Moreover, the rapid growths in economic activities, population and successive influxes of refugees over the last decade have imposed additional demands on energy resources. While Jordan has achieved many sustainable development goals, sustaining these results and reducing the burden of the energy sector on economic and social development will increasingly depend on the transition to a sustainable energy future. The high cost of importing energy puts a heavy burden on the public budget already constrained by running costs. There is no doubt that given the current financial pressures on our economy and its people and the elevated and continuing level of insecurity and conflict in our region, the INDC of Jordan specially those presented in the Vision 2025 are all fair and ambitious.""</p>",2

In the forestry sector, two major initiatives were launched, the Central Forest Spine (CFS) and Heart of Borneo (HOB) to ensure sustainable forest management and use of natural resources.</p> <p>The government will continue to pursue the green growth goal under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020) will further focus on pursuing green growth for sustainability and resilience.

These actions will further reduce Malaysia&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p> <ul> <li>Major barriers for implementation include high costs and capacity constraints</li> </ul> <p>Malaysia developed A Roadmap of Emissions Intensity Reduction in Malaysia in 2014. The study indicated that Malaysia has opportunities across various sectors to meet the reduction target of 40% emissions intensity reduction of GDP. However, while these opportunities exist, considerable efforts would be required to realise these emissions reductions in light of the challenges and barriers described below.</p> <p>TECHNOLOGY COST</p> <p>Many mitigation actions are limited by the cost and suitability of appropriate technologies. Generation cost of renewable energy is still higher than conventional energies while rail based mass transport systems have high capital cost. Benefit relating to electrification of transportation systems are also limited by the current fuel mix used for electricity generation which consist mainly of fossil fuels.</p> <p>INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK and CAPACITY</p> <p>Climate change is a cross cutting issue and currently the institutional framework to address the issue is fragmented. It is often a consequential co-benefit outcome of agencies&rsquo; core responsibilities. Creating long-term commitment from all stakeholders, businesses, civil society, and people, is critical as this transition and associated results will take time. In addition, new competencies and skills need to be developed.</p> <p>LULUCF LEGACY ISSUES</p> <p>Malaysia has a long forest management history. However, there are some areas of forest that have been degraded due to past management effects. Restoration and rehabilitation of these forests incurs high cost and nurturing. Furthermore, the advent of climate change has also highlighted another legacy in forest management, that is, the drained peatlands. In the 1960s and 70s, peatlands were considered a wasteland and draining was considered an effective rehabilitation to improve the productivity. Some of these drained peatlands are now unmanaged and are susceptible to wildfires during the dry seasons. It is also expensive to &ldquo;re-wet&rdquo; these areas.""</p> ",2

"Overview","Description of fairness","<p>Moldova communicated the following information describing how its INDC is fair and ambitious, and contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention:</p><p>""The Republic of Moldova&rsquo;s approach to considering fairness and ambition is to assess how its INDC contributes to meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention, of achieving stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p><p>National commitments are well in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 that correspond to keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.</p><p>It is worthwhile to note that fairness considerations in the national perspectives include various aspects and no single indicator on its own can accurately reflect fairness or a globally equitable distribution of countries&rsquo; efforts.</p><p>It is further important to note that the evolving nature of a country&rsquo;s circumstances is to be reflected in the fairness consideration:</p><ul><li>Responsibility is reflected in a country&rsquo;s past, current and future greenhouse gas emissions. Total emissions, as well as per capita emissions, are to be considered. The Republic of oldova&rsquo;s responsibility in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is low. In 2013, the Republic of Moldova emitted 12.8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> eq (without LULUCF) and 12.7 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq (with LULUCF), which is less than 0.03 percent of current world&rsquo;s emissions. Total and net per capita emissions were less than half of the world&rsquo;s average (3.2 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq/capita vs 6.4 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq/capita, respectively 3.1 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq/capita vs 6.8 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq/capita respectively. Also, the Republic of Moldova has a low level of historic emissions, of about 0.05 per cent (without LULUCF) and/or of about 0.04 per cent (with LULUCF), since 1990.</li><li>The capacity to contribute to solving the climate change problem is closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures. Hence, one aspect of capacity is to take into account the GDP growth level and GDP per capita in fairness considerations. In this context, it is worth mentioning that within 1990-2014 period, the Real GDP decreased in the Republic of Moldova by 29 per cent, from 9.8935 to 6.9881 billion 2010 US$, while the real GDP per capita decreased by 14 per cent, from 2,261.9 to 1,950.2 2010 US$.</li><li>The mitigation potential and abatement costs are other core aspects in considering a fair contribution of a country. The greenhouse gas intensity (&ldquo;CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per GDP&rdquo;) indices decreased considerably within 1990-2013 period in the Republic of Moldova, from 4.4 to 1.9 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per real GDP 2010 US$ (without LULUCF), or by 56.4 per cent; and, from 3.8 to 1.9 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per real GDP 2010 US$ (with LULUCF), or by 56.8 percent respectively. These values are still among the highest within the transition economies from the Central and Eastern Europe and reveal a high mitigation potential to achieve the Republic of Moldova's reduction targets. But, in order to reach the conditional target of up to 78 per cent reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, appropriate international financial support approximately equal to US$ 4.9-5.1 billion, i.e. about US$ 327-340 million per year until 2030, is needed; the support needed will be in addition to the domestic allocations to cover the required abatement costs. This support will allow adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of Moldova towards a low-carbon economy, thus moving towards progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of Real GDP per capita, equal to 4,483 US$/capita in 2030, which will still be approximately one-tenth of EU 28 average, forecasted to be US$ 43,516/capita in 2030. As stated above, along with the international financial support for covering the abatement costs, the country will also need assistance in form of technology transfer and capacity building.""</li></ul>",2

Since 1991, at the initial stage of the period of state independence, and especially during the period 1992-2000, the Republic of Tajikistan had experienced grave consequences resulting from civil war and of the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, with a sharp increase in poverty. During the period 2008-2015, the socio-economic indicators of the Republic of Tajikistan have improved. For the Republic of Tajikistan, the basic priority of climate measures lies in adaptation because of high dependence of the considerable part of the population and of the branches of the economy on climatic conditions, also taking into account the key role of the country's mountain ecosystems in water resources generation and biological diversity for Central Asia. The existing assessed contribution of the Republic of Tajikistan to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 0.02%. In view of a low level of greenhouse gas emissions and a very high share of hydro-power (more than 90%), the level of greenhouse gas emissions of the Republic of Tajikistan will amount to 80-90% by 2030, as compared to 1990 (as stated in the INDC); this will ensure the achievement of socially acceptable and scientifically grounded indicators, both in absolute and per capita terms.

"Overview","Description of fairness","<p>Thailand communicated the following information describing how its INDC is fair and ambitious.</p><p>""Thailand's national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent only 0.84% of global emissions in 2012. The country's share of cumulative emissions from 1990-2012 is 0.75%. In 2012, per capita GHG emissions is at 5.63 tCO<sub>2</sub>e and emissions per GDP (US$ million) is 409.54 tCO<sub>2</sub>e, which is lower than world average. In terms of emission profile, the Second National Communication indicates that 67% of total GHG emissions in Thailand in 2000 is from the energy sector. In 2012, CAIT data indicates 73% share is from energy. Consequently, Thailand's mitigation efforts have focused primarily on the energy, including transport sector.</p> <p>At COP20 in Lima, Thailand pledged our pre-2020 contribution of 7-20% GHG emission reduction by 2020 below business-as-usual (BAU) in the energy and transport sectors. According to a preliminary analysis, Thailand has already achieved 4% of GHG emission reduction from the projected 2020 BAU and is well on track to achieving the 7% target pledged as voluntary domestic efforts by 2020. Our INDC will continue such efforts with ambitious plans in the relevant sectors while considering also our national circumstances and context, including:</p> <p><strong>Thailand has taken early actions in the field of energy and has very ambitious plans in the relevant sectors.</strong></p> <p>Energy security has long been an issue of concern over the course of Thailand's development. In the past, power generation in Thailand relied heavily on crude oil imports. To remedy this, the Government initiated a shift to natural gas in the power generation sector as early as the 1980s. Such effort has continued throughout the 1990s. And, in 2005 about 72% of electricity in Thailand was generated using natural gas, which is already a cleaner alternative to other types of fossil fuels. These early actions imply that Thailand is left with less available choices and faced with higher marginal cost of further reducing GHG emission in the energy sector.</p> <p>Despite some limitations due to our early actions, the Ministry of Energy is taking a step forward to balance three key aspects of energy planning for Thailand: security, economy and ecology, also taking into account the need to address climate change. Ambitious targets are defined in the Power Development Plan (PDP), the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) and the Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP). For example, the PDP sets a target to achieve a 20% share of power generation from renewable sources in 2036. The AEDP aims to achieve a 30% share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption in 2036. The EEP plans to reduce the country&rsquo;s energy intensity by 30% below the 2010 level in 2036.</p> <p>The Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan also proposes ambitious actions to promote road-to-rail modal shift for both freight and passenger transport, which include extensions of mass rapid transit lines, construction of double-track railways and improvement of bus transit in the Bangkok Metro areas. A vehicle tax scheme based on CO<sub>2</sub> emission was also approved and will become effective beginning 2016. In addition, just last year the Government adopted the Waste Management Roadmap, aiming towards more efficient and sustainable waste management and promotion of power generation from waste-to-energy technologies. The roadmap can contribute tremendous environmental benefits in terms of GHG emission and pollution reduction. Currently, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is also studying the potential to reduce carbon emission in the forest sector through the REDD+ Readiness. We will continue to explore further opportunities and cooperation in this sector.</p> <p><strong>Major barriers to successful implementation include high costs and capacity constraints.</strong></p> <p>It is important to incorporate concerns that several of the proposed measures and actions in these ambitious plans are subject to very high investment and operating costs, particularly costs of technologies and infrastructures which can become an important barrier to successful implementation of the plans. Some of the key barriers for the energy sector include, for instance, limitation of grid connection due to inadequate capacity of transmission lines, lack of support by financial institutions for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, lack of domestic technological and technical resources and negative public perception particularly against waste-to-energy and biomass power plants. Several measures require a high level of technical capacity and effective coordination across different sectoral agencies, whereas such technical capacity and effective coordination in a developing country like Thailand is currently lacking. For renewable energy development in particular, the International Energy Agency also cited some of the above-mentioned barriers as common barriers for renewable energy deployment in developing countries. Domestically, Thailand has launched several support mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and access to investment grants and venture capital to promote renewable energy. However, to achieve ambitious and more rapid renewable energy deployment, incentives have to be created for technology developers to cooperate and&nbsp;share technology knowledge to enable technology transfer on a larger scale. International financial support mechanisms such as technical assistance and technology transfer funds for purchasing intellectual property rights for a free distribution of clean energy technologies would be very valuable to accelerate diffusion of renewable energy technologies for developing countries. Furthermore, efforts are needed to inform the public, through lessons-learned and experience sharing from other countries, as well as showcasing success stories from pilot or demonstration projects, for instance. It is therefore crucial that international cooperation through the UNFCCC focus on these cooperative attempts to unlock the potentials of developing countries in their contributions towards the global solutions to climate change by addressing these important identified barriers, making technological solutions more affordable for developing countries and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to implement these solutions more effectively and more sustainably. Successful implementation of these ambitious mitigation plans in Thailand, in addition to our domestic efforts, will be subject to adequate and predictable access to enhanced means of implementation agreed under the UNFCCC.""</p>",2

At first sight it seems rather unfair to ask a country like The Gambia to contribute to the global emission reduction efforts, which implies that resources to be allocated to poverty reduction and development priorities will be arbitrated to take into account the requirements of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Gambia has always shown a progressive standpoint and commendable leadership in the climate change negotiations, as the implications of the current level of mitigation ambition is particularly low and likely to pose tremendous challenges for countries like Gambia. Agriculture, Energy, Water Resources, which are vital sectors for the Gambian economy will severely suffer if global and deep cut do not occur in a near future. For this reason, The Gambia took the leadership and joined the call in 2011 for a universal mobilization of efforts to tackle climate change allowing that global actions protect the future of the most vulnerable countries. By presenting this INDC, the Gambia would like to provide a moral voice for all responsible and capable countries to undertake actions that are proportionate for their responsibilities and capabilities not only for themselves, but for the whole global community. The Gambia is an LDC and according to the Lima Call for Action, it is not mandatory for LDCs to have quantified or quantifiable targets.

Abatement costs vary strongly across countries. It is also to note, that marginal abatement costs increase if a country has undertaken ambitious mitigation actions in the past. In fairness considerations, it is important to merit past efforts and reward early movers.<br /> In Switzerland, abatement costs are high due to the limited availability of short term cost-efficient mitigation potential: Switzerland&rsquo;s energy production is nearly carbon free and there is little heavy industry.
