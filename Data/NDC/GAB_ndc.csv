If any errors are identified, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:ClimateWatch@WRI.org"">ClimateWatch@WRI.org</a>.</br>Gabon commits to reduce GHG emissions by at least 50 percent from baseline scenario emissions in 2025. The commitment could be extended to 2030 and 2050 based on additional studies that will be carried out by COP21. The commitment is to be achieved excluding carbon stocks from forests from the target. Gabon also submitted annexes describing land-use change, flaring from the oil industry, energy, other GHG emissions such as waste, adaptation, and financing."
