The Government is seeking to reduce the increasing costs of electricity generation and ensure a cleaner, more environmentally friendly energy source by exploring the possibility of using alternative forms of energy. Dominica has tremendous potential for geothermal energy and the Government expects that renewable sources will eventually be utilized on a commercial scale.<br /> The Government also expects to undertake the following activities in its effort to develop renewable energy: <br /> <br /> (a) Developing and commercializing geothermal resources through: training programmes; the development of inventories of geothermal resources; the assessment of technology options; the establishment of regulations for harnessing and exporting geothermal energy; designing and financing a geothermal power plant (estimated 120 MW); and the establishment of soft financing for community and small-scale plants; <br /> <br /> (b) Harnessing solar energy through: training programmes; feed-in tariffs; incentives for using solar heating in homes and public buildings; assessments of viable photovoltaic technologies; designing and financing a pilot solar power facility; and soft financing for community and small-scale private plants;<br /> <br /> (c) Harnessing wind energy through: training programmes; the development of a wind atlas for Dominica; feed-in tariffs for wind energy producers; designing and financing a wind farm on the east coast; and soft financing for community and small-scale private plants; <br /> <br /> (d) Harnessing hydropower through: training programmes; the development of an inventory of hydroenergy potential in the country and the assessment of the commercial viability of microhydro and run-of-river technologies; feed-in tariffs for hydropower producers; designing and financing a pilot hydropower plant; and soft financing for community and small-scale plants;<br /> <br /> (e) Promoting 'green communities' through: training on energy and GHG auditing and energy conservation and low-carbon technologies; financing and commissioning energy/GHG audits of cities, public buildings and highway lighting; establishing soft financing for energy conservation and conversion to renewable energy technology, including solar-powered LED street lights; the establishment of green areas in urban development; making public buildings and infrastructure low carbon in Portsmouth; and establishing vehicle upgrade and maintenance programmes; <br /> <br /> (f) Reducing GHG emissions from waste management through: GHG audits of waste landfills; upgrading roads to improve connectivity and reduce travel time and emissions from vehicles; assessing appropriate waste-to-energy technologies; and implementing a pilot project to convert waste to energy in Roseau; <br /> <br /> (g) Protecting carbon sinks through: training on inventory procedures; building the capacity of the Forestry Division to undertake a forestry inventory; determining the carbon uptake of existing forest, agricultural land and marine areas; assessing the viability of protecting additional forest, agricultural land and marine areas; and establishing a compensation framework to support the protection of forest and agricultural land; <br /> <br /> (h) Developing biofuels through: training; assessing the viability of first- and second-generation biofuels; establishing soft financing for a pilot biofuel production plant; and developing supporting legislation; <br /> <br /> (i) Delivering financing for low-carbon technologies through: training on climate change financing; assessing options for financing the conversion to low-carbon technologies using market-based instruments (e.g. a carbon levy); and designing and establishing a climate change trust fund to finance low-carbon technologies; <br /> <br /> (j) Developing low-carbon management services and technologies through: training programmes on energy and GHG auditing; establishing standards and certification programmes for low-energy appliances and equipment; and promoting the certification of low-carbon management services and technology providers.<br /> As regards finance, Dominica communicated that funds in excess of those received from donors under current financing mechanisms will be required to address climate change in a meaningful manner. The country anticipates priority interventions under its Low-Carbon Climate-Resilient Development Strategy being supported by financing from a range of sources, including the Global Environment Facility, the Climate Investment Funds, the Green Climate Fund, SIDS DOCK and others.<br />"
